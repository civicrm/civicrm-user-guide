# Membership Reports

There are a number of techniques for reporting on and analysing your
memberships.

The membership dashboard gives a quick summary of your current
memberships, displaying information for each membership type such as
current totals of members, and then a break down for last month, this
month and current year to date totals. You can also search for specific
membership details using **Advanced Search** or **Find Memberships**. To
learn more about the membership dashboard and using the search features
to find your memberships, refer to the "Finding Memberships" chapter.

This chapter will show you how to view and create membership reports as
well as export membership information so you can do further analysis. 

## Viewing Membership Reports

Out-of-the-box, CiviCRM comes with several membership reports designed
to tell you something specific about your membership:

The **Membership Summary** report shows information about members
grouped by a date frequency you specify, such as month, week, quarter,
year. For example, you can look at the number of members that have
joined each month over a date range, membership types, or any other
custom data that you collect about them.

If you click on a highlighted field you will then see the corresponding
**Membership Detail** report for that row. So clicking on **May 2015**
for membership type **General** shows:

The **Membership Detail** report shows information for each
membership record based on your selected criteria.

lapsed or will lapse before the date you specify.

## Exporting membership records

You may decide to export membership records so that you can do more
analysis, perform document mail merges, or create a specific type of
reports outside of CiviCRM. Exporting membership records allows you to
select a default set of primary fields or choose fields that are
specific to the membership record for export.

You will need to first search for the specific membership records you
would like to export. To learn more about how to search for membership
records, refer to the "Finding Memberships" chapter.

To export membership records:

-   Click on **Memberships > Find Members >**, enter your search
    criteria
-   Then on the "Find Members" search results screen, select the records
    you want to import and in **-actions-** drop down, select **Export
    Members**.
-   You can select **Export PRIMARY fields** or **Select fields for
    import ** and click the **CONTINUE** button

![image](../img/memberships%20export%20memberships%20screen.JPG)

-   If you selected **Export PRIMARY fields**, a file called
    CiviCRM_Member_Search.csv will be created containing the
    membership records based on your search criteria
-   If you selected**Select fields for import**, then include the
    fields you would like to export, check the box for **Save this field
    mapping** if you want to re-use this field mapping for a future
    export, then click the**EXPORT** button. A file called
    CiviCRM_Member_Search.csv will be created containing the
    membership records based on your search criteria and the fields you
    selected to export.
