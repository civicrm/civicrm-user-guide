What is CiviMember
==================

CiviMember is the CiviCRM component that provides functionality to
support and automate the management of memberships. CiviMember allows
you to:

-   define membership types and pricing schemes that meet your needs
-   create self-service options for online membership sign-up and
    renewal, utilising CiviContribute
-   manage memberships manually through the administrative interface
-   create and schedule automated messages to welcome new members,
    remind about upcoming renewal, etc.
-   track and report on your contacts through the membership cycle 
-   grant additional website privileges for members.

The chapters in this section take you through everything you need to
know in order to get the most from CiviMember.

If you are new to CiviMember and planning to use it for your membership
management it is a good idea to review this entire section whilst you
are considering your organisation's membership scheme and working out
how best to model it within CiviCRM. CiviMember provides a high degree
of flexibility, enabling you to configure it to meet most requirements.

Adopting a system like CiviCRM will normally require some changes in
working practices, so it is important to work closely with the people
within your organisation who will have day-to-day responsibility for
managing memberships using CiviCRM as you develop your plans.

Memberships can run from a day to a lifetime, they be free or paid, and
have simple or complex pricing structures. They can be set up to
auto-renew where a compatible payment processor is enabled.

Memberships for any given contact are visible on the contact's summary
screen and on the membership dashboard. They can be searched for through
the Membership Search or Advanced Search, and CiviMember provides four
membership reports, each of which can be customised to better meet your
specific needs.

Conceptually, members are simply contacts in your CiviCRM database with
one or more memberships. The contact may be an individual, a household,
an organisation, or some other contact sub-type, but it is always a
contact to which a membership is applied.

Scenario: Driving membership forward
------------------------------------

The Atlantic Region Public Transit Association (ARPTA) has a complex
requirement with four membership categories:

-   **Regular Members:** Public transit systems. There are three tiered
    levels within this category, based on the size of the system.
    Membership is organization-based, and all employees of the member
    organization receive access to member benefits, such as discounted
    rates at Association events.
-   **Affiliate Members:** Businesses providing goods and services to
    the transit industry. Membership fees are the same for all Affiliate
    Members. Membership is organization-based, and up to 10 employees of
    the member organization receive access to member benefits, such as
    discounted rates at Association events.
-   **Associate Members:** Students, government representatives, public
    interest groups, research institutions, and other interested
    parties. Membership fees are the same for all Associate Members.
    Membership is individual-based.
-   **Honorary Members:** Retired transit system executives and others
    who have made a notable contribution to the industry and
    Association. Membership is individual-based and free for life.

When the ARPTA membership administrator, Sue, initially configured
CiviMember she created a separate membership type for each of the four
member categories described above. This was easily managed by
CiviMember. Initially, they carried on with manually processing
membership renewals and new sign-ups while the system bedded in. 

Last year ARPTA's board agreed that they needed to boost membership
income by improving their membership recruitment and renewal rates,
whilst keeping tight control, and if possible reducing, the amount of
time spent on membership administration.

To help achieve this they used CiviContribute and CiviMember to set up
online sign-up and renewal pages for Regular and Affiliate Members. They
were then able to run targeted membership recruitment campaigns linking
to the online sign-up pages so that potential members could quickly join
online. At the same time, existing members were encouraged to renew
online, by logging in to the member section on the ARPTA website.

These steps streamlined ARPTA's sign-up process, eliminated a lot of
admin work and gave Sue a clear view of new sign-ups, recent renewals
and expired members that need to be chased. Through CiviContribute, she
can produce a monthly spreadsheet for her accounts department with all
membership fees received, which they import into their accounting
software. With the time she saves on paperwork she is able to engage
more with members and is much more involved in the annual conference,
which ARPTA manages using CiviEvent.

ARPTA's board were also pleased with the results of the move to online
sign-up and renewal, which, in conjunction with their marketing
campaign, led to a 30% jump in new members over a year. Their analysis
also showed a 40% improvement in membership retention (in part because
Sue was able to devote more time to contacting lapsed and expired
members, and in part because members reported that they found it easy
and convenient to renew online, and were prompted to do so by the
reminder emails that Sue had set up using the Schedule Reminders
feature. Their market research also showed that members appreciated the
fact that they were being contacted more regularly by Sue, and felt more
engaged with ARPTA as a result.
