Glossary
========

Accidental Techie
-----------------

Someone who has inherited the role of **IT** technical support but whose
primary role maybe something else; often has little or no formal IT
training (which is not always a bad thing!).

Accordion
---------

A **javascript**-based effect on a web page that allows additional
content to be revealed or hidden (often referred to as collapsed or
uncollapsed) without the user leaving the web page.

ACL (Access Control List)
-------------------------

ACLs define **permissions** for a group of **contacts** to perform an
operation (e.g. edit, view, delete) on a set of data or a type of
record. For example, you could set up a group called "Administrators"
that allows people to view and edit all contact records, and a group
called "Volunteers" that can view contact records but not edit them.

Activities
----------

An activity in **CiviCRM** is a record of any scheduled or completed
interaction with one or more **contacts**. Examples include meetings,
phone calls, emails, event attendances and contributions. You can define
additional types of activities as needed.

Admin / Administrator
---------------------

The person or persons that maintain a **server** or web-based software
like **CiviCRM**. Administration includes maintenance, configuration,
**backup**, security, creating and deleting user accounts and so on. 

AGM (Annual General Meeting)
----------------------------

An AGM is a meeting held every year by an organisation to inform its
members of previous and future activities. Certain types of
organisations are required by law to hold an AGM.

**AGPL (Affero General Public License)**
----------------------------------------

A license for **open source software**. **CiviCRM** uses the [AGPL
version 3.0 license](http://www.affero.org/oagpl.html), which gives you
the right to do with the **software** as you like and guarantees that
the **source code** will always protect your rights in this way. 

Alpha Version
-------------

A **software**version that contains very new **source code** with new
functionality and bug fixes. An alpha version is released for testing
purposes, and for people who want to follow its development, but it is
not considered to be anywhere near ready for general release or use.

Apache
------

The most popular web**server software**. Apache is free and **open
source** (see also **FLOSS**).

API (Application Programming Interface)
---------------------------------------

An interface employed by a **software** application to enable
interaction between itself and other software. 

Backup
------

Protecting your data by regularly making copies and storing them
independently of the original files so they can be restored if
necessary.

Bandwidth
---------

The speed at which you can transfer information through a network or
internet connection. If a connection can transfer a lot of information
it is said to be "high bandwidth" or "high speed."

Beta Version
------------

A **software** version that is in good condition but still needs testing
to make sure it functions as intended before general release. Testing
beta versions is a helpful way to participate in the **CiviCRM**
community.

Blog
----

Short for web-log. A website which is regularly updated with news and
views from one or more individuals.

Bug
---

An error that prevents **software** from behaving as the user would
expect.

Bug Reporting / Bug Fixing
--------------------------

The process of reporting **bugs** to the **software** **developer**(s),

Bug Tracker
-----------

An official repository for recording **bugs**. The **CiviCRM** bug

Cache
-----

A recent copy of frequently used data that can be quickly and easily
accessed. This is especially useful if the data is complicated or takes
a large effort to generate. The disadvantage of caching is that data can
become out of date, but this normally isn't a problem. Even caching data
for 5 minutes might be useful in certain circumstances. If a page is
accessed 1,000 times in 5 minutes, having a cached version means the
data will only need to be generated once.

A web cache holds copies of recently visited web page files. Sometimes a
user may need to clear their web cache in order to see updated
information on a web page.

Canvassing
-----------

Is the systematic initiation of direct contact with a target group of
individuals commonly used during political campaigns. A campaign team
