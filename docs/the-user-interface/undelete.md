Undelete
========

By default, deleted contacts are sent to the trash, and may be recovered
at a later date by an administrator (or anyone holding the "access
deleted contacts" permission"). To restore these contacts, go to
**Advanced Search**, enter the contact’s details and check the **Search
in Trash** check-box at the bottom of the **Basic Criteria** section.

From the list of results, you can either recover contacts individually
using the **Restore** link at the end of the row, or by choosing
**Restore contacts** from the action drop-down menu.

If you are sure that you no longer have a need for the particular
contact, you can delete them permanently.

Note that you can disable the trash function if you like in **Administer > System Settings > Misc (Undelete, PDFs, Limits, Logging, Captcha,
etc.)**
