Integrating with Drupal
=======================

Of all the three CMS that integrate with CiviCRM, Drupal has received
the most attention, and offers the most options when it comes to
integration. This is in part due to the fact that the Drupal community
is largely a developer community.

When you create a new Drupal site **User** and CiviCRM is installed a
corresponding CiviCRM **Contact** is also created. Both users and
contacts have a separate identification or index number.

Drupal Roles and permissions
----------------------------

*See also the permissions and access control chapter in initial set up
for a general discussion of access control.* 

Your Drupal website allows you to create a series of **Roles.** Your
website administrator give roles to site users and grant each role
the **permission** to perform a certain series of tasks (view, edit,
delete, and administer contacts) or access a certain set of information
(CiviCRM Contacts, CiviMail, CiviEvents, Drupal Users, specific content
types, etc.)

For more information on Drupal Roles, please read the documentation on
Drupal Roles at Drupal.org:

-   User: Access and management
    settings [http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/user](http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/user)
-   Managing Access Control with Permissions and Drupal Roles
    [http://drupal.org/node/22275](http://drupal.org/node/22275)

Drupal permission settings allow you to decide what tasks a
specific **Role** can perform or what information a certain **Role** has
access to. Drupal permissions determine how much access a certain type
of user has to configure modules, view, create, edit, or change types of
content, users, or CiviCRM Contact information.

For more information on Drupal Permission settings, please read the
documentation on Drupal Permissions at Drupal.org:

-   User: Access and management settings
   [http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/user](http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/user) 
    
-   Assigning permissions and users to
    roles [http://drupal.org/node/22278](http://drupal.org/node/22278)

-   Adjusting permissions after adding
    modules [http://drupal.org/node/22279](http://drupal.org/node/22279)
-   Permissions
    reference [http://drupal.org/node/132202](http://drupal.org/node/132202)
-   Views module
    permissions [http://drupal.org/node/1089746](http://drupal.org/node/1089746)

Drupal roles are global and will override relevant access controls (see
chapter Initial Setup> Permissions and Access Control) setup in
CiviCRM. For example you can setup Access Control in CiviCRM to restrict
access to contacts but if the Drupal permission 'Access All Contacts' is
set anyone with that role will be able to see all contacts regardless.

Drupal Taxonomies, Content Access, or other Role-based User Access Modules
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several Drupal Modules that determine what
Drupal **Roles** have access to which types of content in your Drupal
website. This can be based on Drupal taxonomies, by selecting access to
specific nodes, settings on a specific views, pages, or panels, or based
on certain contexts or rules. A few of the most common modules used for
controlling access to content or include options for controlling content
based on Drupal **Roles** are:

-   Views [http://drupal.org/project/views](http://drupal.org/project/views)
-   Panels [http://drupal.org/project/panels](http://drupal.org/project/panels)
-   Chaos Tools Suite and Page
    Manager [http://drupal.org/project/ctools](http://drupal.org/project/ctools)
-   Context [http://drupal.org/project/context](http://drupal.org/project/context)
-   Content
    Access [http://drupal.org/project/content_access](http://drupal.org/project/content_access)
-   Taxonomy Access
    Control [http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_access](http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_access)

Drupal Views 
--------------

[Views](http://drupal.org/project/views) is a powerful Drupal module
that allows you to display website content e.g. a list of latest news
for the home page. CiviCRM integrates with Drupal Views and allows
CiviCRM data to be shown on your website. For instance, if you wanted to
create a page called 'Partner Organizations' and display it publicly you
could: 

1. Select criteria for what Contact data will be displayed such as: 
 * Organization contacts only 
 * That are tagged 'Partner' in CiviCRM 
 * That have a membership of status 'New' or 'Current' 
2. Choose which data will be shown such as: 
  * Organization name 
  * State/Province 
  * Website 
  * Phone number 
3. Choose to show the data in either table or paragraph format 
4. Allow the public to filter the results themselves by State/Province

This is just a simple example, the possibilities of Drupal Views and
CiviCRM are far reaching. 

### Configuration 

If you have your Drupal and CiviCRM in separate databases adding CiviCRM
support to Views takes a small bit of configuration. Views must be told
where to look for CiviCRM data. **Administer > System
Settings > CMS Database Integration** shows some code that must be
copied and pasted into the Drupal *settings.php* file after (but not
replacing) the existing database connection code. If you have trouble
consider asking for help in
the [forums](http://forum.civicrm.org/) or [hiring a
consultant](http://civicrm.org/what/experts). If you are using Custom
Data sets in CiviCRM, anytime you add a new data **set** (not just a
field) you must repeat this process.

### Creating Views Using CiviCRM Data

Views are located in the **Structure** section of the Drupal
administrative menu. When you create a View, give it a name and select
what kind of data you wish to show.

Generally speaking if your view is focused on Contacts (which most are)
you will select Show: CiviCRM Contacts. If you wish to display details
about other CiviCRM data such as events, relationships, contributions or
activities there are additional options that might provide more data
fields for those types. 

![image](../img/Views-CiviCRM-Partner-1.png) 

After the View is created, edit the fields, filters, display and other
configurations to show the data exactly how you'd prefer. Views does
take some experimentation and/or training to get it right. Feel free to
ask questions on the [forums](http://forum.civicrm.org/) or [hire a
consultant](http://civicrm.org/what/experts) if you become stuck.

![image](../img/Views-CiviCRM-Partner-3.png)  

This is a sample configuration using Views 3 in a Drupal 7 environment.
Your View will probably be slightly different, but this gives you some
examples to get started with.

### Other Things Views and CiviCRM Can Do

-   Lists of upcoming events
-   Building reports on contributions, activities or event registrants
-   Honor roll listing of recent donors
-   Staff, board of directors or committee lists
-   A list of current members
-   ...and more! 

Drupal modules {#drupal-organic-groups}
--------------

When thinking about website integration with Drupal, it is important to
understand the concept of **Drupal modules**. It might help you to
think of a module as an application which provides a certain bit of
functionality. For example the *calendar* module allows you to display
calendars on your website.

The Drupal distribution of CiviCRM comes with a number of Drupal modules
which give you the ability to integrate CiviCRM with Drupal in various
different ways. This chapter outlines CiviCRM's Webform integration
module and then looks at the Drupal integration modules that come with
CiviCRM.

Webform CiviCRM Integration
---------------------------

Just as Views can *output* data in virtually any way imaginable, this
module allows you to have data *input* exactly the way you want.The
webform CiviCRM integration is extensive and offers many different
options for things that can happen as part of the form submission.

You can create and update contacts, group subscriptions, tags,
relationships, cases, custom data, activities, memberships, event
participants and take payments online via webforms. They can offer
greater flexibility when compared to standard CiviCRM Profiles.

For example, you can create a form which adds a family with all
relationships / you can add a new member form with a multi-page form
which includes question logic / you can create a new activity when
someone submits the form. Webform CiviCRM has extensive online
documentation which you should read to make the most out of its
functionality.

For more information see:
[http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Webform+CiviCRM+Integration](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Webform+CiviCRM+Integration)

CiviCRM Organic Groups Sync {#drupal-organic-groups}
---------------------------

The Organic Groups CiviCRM module
([http://drupal.org/project/og_civicrm](http://drupal.org/project/og_civicrm))
integrates Organic Groups from a Drupal site with CiviCRM groups. This
is useful for groups that require Organic Group functionality on their
website but also need to be tracked within CiviCRM. Once an Organic
Group of Drupal users are integrated into CiviCRM, the Drupal group can
be used for mailings, tracking address information, tracking activities
or anything else normally done with CiviCRM contacts.

Once the Organic Groups CiviCRM module is installed and enabled in
Drupal it automatically creates two CiviCRM groups for each existing
Drupal Organic Group:

-   A normal group containing a contact record for each corresponding
    user who is part of an Organic Group. This group is assigned the
    same name as the linked Organic Group.
-   An access control group containing the contact record of the
    administrator of the corresponding Organic Group. This gives the OG
    group admin the ability to view and edit members of their group in
    CiviCRM.

The groups are synchronised one way only, from the Drupal Organic Groups
to CiviCRM groups. When a new user is added to or signs up for an
Organic Group, they are automatically added to the corresponding CiviCRM
group. If they leave the Organic Group then they are removed from the
CiviCRM group. If an Organic Group is deleted, the CiviCRM group is also
deleted. However, the reverse of each of this situations is not true; a
contact added to the CiviCRM group will not appear in the Drupal Organic
Group, a contact removed from the CiviCRM group will still remain in the
Drupal Organic Group, and if you delete the CiviCRM group, the Drupal
Organic Group will still remain. Therefore, this integration is meant to
be used when you administer the group from the Drupal side.

CiviGroup Roles Sync
--------------------

The CiviGroup Roles Sync module allows administrators of Drupal Websites
to streamline the user experience for donors and staff. The CiviGroup
Roles Sync module allows you to:

-   Allow board members, committees, staff, and volunteers to access
    specific content or perform specific tasks.
-   Provide customized experiences for users of specific groups when
    they access your website. For example, when a major donor logs into
    the website display a letter from the President thanking the donor
    for his contribution and participation, or provide a major donors
    with pre-registration access to upcoming events and exclusive news
    or resources.

You should spend some time assessing the different ways that different
sorts of users interact with your website, being sure to ask yourself
whether or not the user experience is dependent on specific organized
groups, teams, committees, or task forces or on whether or not a contact
meets a specific set of criteria, or if you should apply roles to users
manually.

In essence, it allows you to synchronize Drupal users that have a
certain role with CiviCRM contacts in a certain group.

### Preparation


Before using CiviGroup Roles Sync module you should have the following
prepared:

-   your organization's Groups should be created.
-   the roles you will need for each use case should be created in
    Drupal.
-   if you are using additional modules to fine-tune access, you should
    have all modules you need installed and configured

When determining what Groups and what Drupal Roles you should create it
is important to remember that multiple Group Types may grant the same
Drupal Role and each Group can be used to grant multiple Drupal roles.

You should enable the module from the Drupal module administration
screen.

### Syncing CiviCRM Groups to Drupal Roles

-   Navigate to the CiviGroup Role Sync configuration screen.

-   Click on **Add Association Rule.**

-   Under **CiviCRM Group** select the Group that you want a user to
    have in order to be granted a specific Drupal Role.
-   Under **Drupal Role** select the Drupal Role that should be granted.
-   Click on **Add Association Rule** when you are finished configuring
    your new association rule.

You can always edit or delete existing association rules from the same
configuration screen.

CiviMember Roles Sync
---------------------

The CiviMember Roles Sync module allows administrators of Drupal
Websites to streamline the user experience for organization members. The
CiviMember Roles Sync module allows you to.

-   Automatically grant a Drupal Role to a user based on the type of
    membership he/she has with your organization and whether or not
    he/she is currently in good standing.
-   Allow a user to access member-only content or perform specific
    member-only tasks.
-   Restrict a non-member or expired member user from accessing
    member-only content or performing member-only tasks until he/she
    registers or renews membership with your organization.

### Scenario: Member-only Content

The Retail Baker's Association of America (RBA) connects bakery
suppliers and owners across the country to foster a community that
encourages exchange of business and industry information, networking,
mentoring, and business opportunities, and establish industry standards
through certification, research, and school programs.

Visitors to their website fall into three different user experiences:

-   Non-Members who purchase resources and materials from RBA's online
    boutique. A non-Member must register for a user account to make a
    transaction so that he or she can keep track of purchase history, so
    that RBA can petition him or her for membership in the future.
-   Current members in good standing who have access to member-only
    resources including discussion boards, programs, marketing
    materials, and digital version of RBA publications.
-   Members with expired memberships or former members who need to renew
    need to log into the RBA website to renew their membership, but
    should not have access to member-only resources until their
    membership has been reactivated.

In order to save their staff from having to grant the Drupal Role
"Active Member" to a user each time he or she renews his or her
membership and then remove the "Active Member" role if that user cancels
his or her membership or allows his or her membership to expire, RBA
uses CiviMember Role Sync to grant the "Active Member" role to any user
who is either a new or current member and any user who's membership has
fallen into the grace period. Now when a user registers or renews his or
her membership he or she will automatically be granted access to RBA's
Member-Only web content.

### What You Need to Know

This section covers what you need to think about before beginning to
work with CiviMember Role Sync.

You should spend some time assessing the different ways that different
sorts of users interact with your website, being sure to ask yourself
whether or not the use case is dependent on your membership structure
or dependent on the organization of committees, teams, and contacts
meeting a specific set of criteria, or if your workflow simply does not
warrant the use of CiviMember Role Sync at all.

### CiviCRM Membership Types

You should have a full understanding of CiviCRM Membership Types and
CiviCRM Membership Statuses before you begin working with the CiviMember
Role Sync module. You can learn more about the CiviMember component by
reviewing the **MEMBERSHIP** chapter.

### Configuring CiviMember Roles Sync

Before using CiviMember Roles Sync module you should have the following
prepared:

-   your organization's Membership Types and Membership Statuses should
    be created and configured in the CiviMember component.
-   the roles you will need for each use case should be created in
    Drupal.
-   what content each Membership Type should grant permissions to should
    be agreed upon by your staff
-   what tasks each Membership Type should grant permission to should be
    agreed upon by your staff
-   if you are using additional modules to fine-tune access, you should
    have all modules you need installed and configured

When determining what Membership Types and what Drupal Roles you should
create it is important to remember that multiple Membership Types may
grant the same Drupal Role and each Membership Type can be used to grant
multiple Drupal roles.

*For example: The Retail Bakers Association of America has five
different membership types: Corporate Sponsor, Bakery, Individual,
Student, and Retired Bakery. Having any one of the five Membership Types
will grant a user the "Active Member" Drupal Role that gives access to
the member-only content. In addition to this, users with the Corporate
Sponsor Membership Type should have access to additional exclusive
content. RBA decides calls the Drupal role used to access this
additional exclusive content "Corporate Member" and user with the
Corporate Sponsor Membership Type will be granted the "Corporate Member"
role in addition to the "Active Member" role.*

#### Enabling CiviMember Roles Sync Module

1. 
To enable the CiviMember Roles Sync Module navigate to your list of
installed Drupal modules.

    -   Drupal 6: Go to **Administer > Site Building > Modules**
    -   Drupal 7: Go to **Modules** from the Administration Menu at the
    top of your screen.

1. 
Find the Module **CiviMember Roles Sync** and check the box to the left
of the module's name.

1. 
Click on **Save Configuration**.

#### Syncing CiviCRM Membership Types to Drupal Roles

1. 
Navigate to the CiviMember Role Sync configuration screen.

    -   Drupal 6: Go to *Administer > Site Configuration > CiviMember
    Roles Sync*
    -   Drupal 7: Go to *Configuration > CiviMember Roles Sync*

1. 
Click on **Add Association Rule.**

1. 
Under **Select a CiviMember Membership Type** select the Membership Type
that you want a user to have in order to be granted a specific Drupal
Role.

1. 
Under **Select a Drupal Role** select the Drupal Role that should be
granted. 
*Example: RBA wants any user with a Current Bakery Membership Type to be
granted the "Active Member" role, so the RBA staff creates a new
Association Rule and selects Bakery under Select a CiviMember Membership
Type and selects "Active Member" under Select a Drupal Role.*

1. 
Under **Current Status** select the Membership Status that a user
should have to be granted your selected Drupal Role.
*Example: RBA wants to grant any user who has a Membership Status of
either New, Current, or Grace access to the member-only website content,
so the RBA staff checks the boxes next to those three Membership
Statuses.*

1. 
Under **Expired Status** select the Membership Status that will revoke
the Drupal Role from the user. *Example: RBA wants to make sure that any user who's membership expires
or cancels their membership has their access to the member-only website
content revoked, so the RBA staff checks the boxes next to Expired and
Canceled.*

1. 
Click on **Add Association Rule** when you are finished configuring your
new association rule.

1. 
The page will reload, and you should see the message "Your Association
Rule has been added."

1. 
Repeat steps 1-8 to add all necessary association rules for your
organization. Once you have finished adding all of your association
rules, move on to step 10.

1. 
Click on the tab **Manually Synchronize**

1. 
Click on **Synchronize CiviMember Membership Types to Drupal Roles
Now**. This will put your new CiviMember Role Sync Association Role
immediately into effect.

#### Editing Existing Association Rules

You can always edit or delete existing association rules.

1. 
To edit or delete an existing Association Rule, Navigate to the
CiviMember Role Sync configuration screen.

    -   Drupal 6: Go to *Administer > Site Configuration > CiviMember
    Roles Sync*
    -   Drupal 7: Go to *Configuration > CiviMember Roles Sync*

1. 
You should now see a list of all existing CiviMember Role Sync
Association Rules. If not, click on **List Association Rule(s)** tab. 
 
    *   Edit an Existing Association Rule 
        *   Find the Association Rule you want to make changes to and click
on **edit** for that Association rule.
        *   Make the changes to your Association Rule and when yo are finished click
on **Edit association rule**. 

    *   Delete an Association Rule

        *  Find the Association Rule you want to remove and click on **delete** for
that Association Rule.

        *  Your association rule will be deleted. You will not need to confirm
deletion.

#### Configure when Synchronization Should Happen

 You can select several different options for when synchronization
should occur by navigating to the CiviMember Role Sync Configure screen.

-   Drupal 6: Go to **Administer > Site Configuration > CiviMember
    Roles Sync > Configure**
-   Drupal 7: Go to **Configuration > CiviMember Roles Sync >
    Configure**

#### Automatic Synchronization Methods:

-   Synchronize whenever someone logs in or logs out: This method will
    trigger synchronization only after a user logs in or out of his or
    her account. You should be careful when using this method because if
    you have long user sessions a user could continue to have access to
    actions or content until he or she finally logs out. (This is the
    default setting)
-   Synchronize when a Drupal Cron occurs: This method relies on a cron
    to trigger synchronization. Learn more about Drupal Cron at:
    [http://drupal.org/cron](http://drupal.org/cron)
-   Synchronize when membership is updated: This method will synchronize
    when the user registers for or renews his or her membership and when
    the organization staff updates a user's membership information from
    the back office.
-   Disable Automatic Synchronization: This method relies on an
    organization staff member to manually trigger synchronization. To
    manually trigger synchronization, go to* *CiviMember Roles Sync
    settings, click on the Manually Synchronize tab, and click
    on Synchronize CiviMember Membership Types to Drupal Roles Now.

Be sure to click **Save Configuration** after making any changes.
