Keeping track of events and participants
========================================

After creating your event and providing the registration form to web
site visitors, you can manage your event participants through the
CiviEvent administrative tools. These tasks vary depending on the type
of event you are organising. This chapter outlines how to view your
events and participants and describes how CiviCRM supports a variety of
the associated administrative tasks.

Dashboard
-----------

The CiviEvent Dashboard (**Events > Dashboard**) brings all your events
and participant information together in one place (see screenshot).
It displays an Event Summary table, providing a summary of up to ten
scheduled and recent Events. Click the **Event name** to view the event
as it will be displayed to site visitors. Click the **Participants
count** to see a list of participants.

![EventSummary](../img/CiviCRM-EverydayTasks-EventSummary-en.png "EventSummary")

To run your own customized searches, click** Find more event
participants** at the end of the page. Here you can search by
Participant Name, Event, Date Range and Status.

From the Dashboard you can also:

-   click on **Manage Events** to find and manage specific events
-   click on **New Event** to create a new event page
-   use the icons for RSS feeds and calendars to use the data in
    external applications.

Finding and viewing events
----------------------------

Another way to access your events is to navigate to **Events > Manage
Events**. This screen gives you a list of all CiviEvents that have been
created. Search filters at the top of the page allow you to search for
events by name, by specific event type or by date. At the right hand
side of the page you have four links for each event:

-   **Configure** - access to amend the settings of the event including
    Information and Settings, Location, Fees, Online Registration,
    Schedule Reminders and Tell a Friend
-   **Participants** - quick links to lists of participants who are
    registered or attending the event, or participants who are not
    attending
-   **Event Links** - quick links to Register Participant and the live
    event pages including the event information page and the live online
    registration page.

Finding and administering participants
----------------------------------------

This section describes some common tasks and searches associated with
event participants. Note that these tasks all refer to existing event
participants. If you are looking for how to add participants, please see
the *Manual event registration* chapter.

### Overview of participants for all upcoming events

1.  Navigate to **Events > Dashboard**
2.  Click the **Counted:** link to see all the contacts for an event.

If any count is zero, the associated text will not be a hyperlink. Some
participant roles may not count for the event total, such as someone who
is on the clean-up duty.

### Find participants for any event with a variety of criteria

1.  Navigate to **Events > Find Participants**.
2.  In the event name field, start typing to see a list of events. Click
    on the event you want. Set additional search choices for the fields
    you want to see.
3.  Click Search.

When the search returns results, you have the opportunity to select all
of the resulting participants or a subset, and perform an action on
them. Available **Actions** include:

-  **Cancel registration** for the selected participants.

-  **Delete participants from event:** Deleting participants does *not* delete the
    contact record; it will delete all transactions and activities
    associated with the participant *for this event*. Note that this
    action cannot be undone.

- **Email - send now** CiviCRM also lets you generate an
    email on the fly to your search result list. For example, you may
    want to let recipients know details about the event in advance, such
    as parking options or changes to the programme.    

-  **Export participants:** This allows you to export a predefined set
    of fields (export mapping) or create yourexport mapping that can be
    saved for reuse. The software exports to CSV format, which can be
    easily opened in standard spreadsheet software or directly used for
    mail merges.

-  **Group - add contacts** to an existing group or one you create during this action.

-  **Group - create smart group:** Smart groups are saved search results based on
    defined criteria, similar to a query. The advantage of a smart group
    is that the system will rerun the query using the criteria you have
    defined each time you open the smart group. This is particularly
    helpful for complex search criteria that you need to view on a
    regular basis.

-  **Name badges - print:** Select the type of badge you require
    and a printable PDF will be generated with the names of the selected
    participants (see *Event Badges* subsection in this chapter).

-  **PDF letter - print for participants**

-  **Participant status - change (emails sent)** When using this feature emails will be sent to participants when the status is changed from one which belongs to the pending class (eg Pending (pay later), Pending from approval) to either **Registered** or **Attended** (positive class).  Emails will also be sent if the status is changed to Expired or Cancelled.

-  **Print selected rows** This prints that are shown on the screen for the rows you have selected.

-  **Update multiple participants:** This feature is useful if
    you wish to edit multiple fields for multiple participants in a
    table grid layout. Note that you must create the profile set you
    wish to use before implementing this action. If you are not familiar
    with how Profiles work, please see the *Profiles* chapter in
    the *Organising your Data* section.


### List participant's individual fees

1.  Navigate to **Search > Custom Searches**.
2.  Click on **Event Aggregate**.
3.  Choose your search criteria, and click **Search**.

### Changing event registration selections for an existing participant

Sometimes the details of an existing registration needs to be changed.
Some examples are:

-   A volunteer for an event has been asked to register online selecting
    a pay later option for the event fees. Back-office staff want to
    change the person's role from attendee to volunteer and select a
    zero fee option from an admin-only price field.
-   A conference participant decides they no longer want to attend the
    conference dinner and requests a refund of the dinner fee.
-   A participant decides after registering online that they do want to
    attend the pre-conference workshop and contacts the registration
    office with that request giving their credit card details for the
    extra charge.
-   A child registered for a holiday program decides she want to do
    archery rather than pottery one afternoon. Although there is no
    difference in fees, back-office staff need to change her event
    registration so that they know where the child should be for that
    session.

All of these situations can be managed by back-office staff editing the
participant's event registration as follows:

1.  Navigate to the participant"s event registration (One way to do this
    is via **Events > Find Participants**)
2.  Select **View** or **Edit** (towards the right of the event record)

    **![image](../img/z_sprint14_PartiallyPaidRegistration.png)**

3.  Click on **Change Selections.**

4.  Make the required adjustments. The event fee will be adjusted
    appropriately and the event status will be set to **partially
    paid**, **registered** or **pending refund** based on the difference
    between the new event fee and the contribution(s) already processed.



**![image](../img/z_sprint14_ChangeRegistrationSelections.png)**

Additional payments (credit card or offline methods) or a refund
(offline methods only) will need to be entered via the **record payment** link associated with the event registration record as
described in the section on partial payments.



Event badges
-------------

You can create custom name badges for your event.

Navigate to **Administer>CiviEvent>Event Badge Layout>New Badge
Layout** and you will see the following set-up screen.

![image](../img/Event%20Badges%20UIv2.png)

Points to consider are:

**Label format:** Four options are available

-   Avery 5395 - 2-1/3" x 3-3/8"
-   A6 Badge Portrait 150x106
-   Fattorini Name Badge 100x65
-   Hanging Badge 3-3/4''x4-3/4''

**Image (top left)** and/or **Image (top right):** You can select an
existing image or upload a new one.  Images can be positioned on the
right and the left so that your logo and that of you major sponsor could
be included.

**Elements - Rows:** Most standard or custom contact, event and
participant fields can be selected to provide up to 6 rows on the labels
or you can select **spacer** to improve the layout. Typical fields to
include would be display name, current employer, country and/or
participant role. If you have set up the appropriate custom fields you
could also include which sessions the participant has registered for and
which meal option they selected.

**Barcode?:** A linear barcode or QR code can be added at the bottom of
the badge.

**Enabled?:** This needs to be ticked for people to use this badge
layout. If you want to keep a special layout for your annual conference
you could untick this box for most of the year to prevent accidental
usage.

**Reserved?:** Select this option if you want to ensure that admin users
do not accidentally delete the badge layout.

Note: You will not be able to preview the badge layout unless at least
one event has been created and at least one participant has been
registered.

**Printing Name Badges**

Once your list of event particpants is finalised you can print the name
badges for the event as follows:

To print name badges, do the following:

-   Go to **Events>Find Participants**.
-   Select the relevant participants.
-   Choose **Print Event Name Badges** from the drop-down list of
    actions and Click Go.
-   Select the name badge layout for this event.

-   Click **Make Name Badges**

A PDF file will be created that you can print on the appropriate-sized
labels.
