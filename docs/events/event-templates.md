# Event templates

If you need to set up a number of events with similar configurations,
you can streamline the process using event templates.

The steps for creating event templates are similar to those described
earlier for creating an event. The main differences are:

-   Assign a descriptive template title that clearly identifies the type
    of event this template is used for (e.g., Monthly community meetup
    with online registration).
-   There are no starting and ending dates in the template form. That
    information will always be specific to an actual event instance.

Click **Events > Event Templates**.

-   To create a template, start by navigating to **Events > Event
    Templates** and clicking **Add Event Template**. Enter template
    title and event type. 
-   Select campaign if all events created from this template should be
    associated with a campaign.
-   Continue the normal event set-up process using the settings that
    will be constant for all events to be created using this template.
-   Common characteristics might include location, event fees, online
    registration settings, tell-a-friend settings, etc.

Once you've created an event template, you can select that template (as
shown in the following screenshot) when you start to create a new event.
Your event will be pre-filled with the saved configuration properties.
