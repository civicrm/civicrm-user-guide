# Complex event fees

The regular fees layout form outlined in *Creating an event* chapter of
this section is a very simple structure that allows the registrant to
select one fee option from the list. Often this single-option format
does not meet the complex demands of your event registration structure.
This chapter describes how **price sets** and **discounts** can be used
in CiviEvent to compose more complex pricing options.

## Price sets

Price Sets allow you to break event fees into smaller pieces, and set a
fee for each piece. Using a price set, you can offer optional programmes
and features (e.g. an optional post-conference dinner or a book) at
extra cost.

Here's an example of how a price set looks to a person who is
registering for a Conference that includes optional pre-conference
training sessions, meals and lodging:

![The page contains a listbox "Registration fees". This is a required field and contains "General admission $125". Then there are optional checkboxes for the pre-conference training and fields where you can enter a quantity for number of meals and number of nights.](/img/CiviCRM_update-CiviEvent-PriceSetRegistration-en.png "PriceSetRegistration")

**Creating a New Price Set**

To create a new price set:

1.  Navigate to**CiviEvent > New Price Sets**
2.  In the Price Set form, enter the name of your price set, and check
    **Used For** > Event
3.  Select the **financial type** to be used (in this case it will be
    Event Fee)
4.  It may be helpful to also add some pre or post form help: some help
    text for the user
5.  Check the **Is this price set active** box  
6.  Press **Save**
7.  A form appears for you to create the first field in your price set.

#### Creating a New Price Field

Begin by entering a name for the event item in the Field Label**.**

![Example shows a price field "pre-conference training" with two price field options: collaborations skills and advanced group facilitation.](/img/event_price_set_v3.png)

The Input Field Type has a structure similar to custom data fields, with
some unique qualities and usage relevant to fee structures.

-   **Text/Numeric Quantity:** allows you to set a unit price. When the
    form is presented to the registrant to fill it, it displays a text
    box where the registrant enters a quantity. The quantity entered is
    multiplied by the unit value to calculate the fee.
-   **Select:** displays a dropdown box where the registrant selects one
    option from the list.
-   **Radio:** displays multiple options in a list, allowing the
    registrant to select one fee choice.
-   **Checkbox:** displays fields in a list where the registrant can
    select or unselect any number of options.

You can combine these field types to create virtually any fee structure.

Enter a number in the Participant Count field if you want to increment
the number of registered participants per unit against the maximum
number of participants allowed for this event. For example, if this
price field is for a table at a fundraiser which seats eight people, you
would set Participant Count to 8.

For Text/Numeric Quantity fields, enter an amount in the Price field.
For Select, Radio and Checkbox types you will enter a price for each
option in the table of options (shown in the screenshot above).

If you want to display the price next to the event item, check the
Display Amount? box.

As when creating other custom data, you can enter a description for the
Field Help, decide whether the event item is required, select whether
the event item is visible to the public or only to the administrator in
the Visibility field, and indicate whether the event item is Active.
These fields are described in the Custom fields chapter in Organising
your data.

In addition you can choose the dates when this price field is active.
This means you can have a series of price fields offering, for example,
discounted rates for people who register very early for your event, the
standard rates for people who register up to two weeks before the event
and premium rates for people who register in the last two weeks before
the event.

Next, you can either press **Save** to finish configuring this event
item, or **Save and New** to create another price field for this price
set.

Once you finish configuring your price set, you add it to your event on
the Fees tab. Select the name of your price set in the Price Set
field as shown in the following screenshot.

As with custom data fields, it is to your advantage to give thought to
the structure of your registration fees and build the price set before
creating the event. However, if you begin the event creation process and
determine that you needed to construct a price set, you can complete the
process, create the price set, and then return to the event
configuration page to assign the price set.

Price sets can be reused in multiple events. This is particularly
helpful for organizations that run multiple events in a series, such as
a regional training seminar program.

**Managing price sets**

To manage and administer existing CiviEvent price sets:

-   navigate to **Manage Price Sets** and choosing the **Events** link
    OR
-   navigating to **CiviEvent > Manage Price Sets** and
    choose **Administer**

## Discounts

CiviEvent also lets you offer early bird discounts (discounts determined
by sign-up date), if you use a simple fee structure. These will override
regular event fees during the period you specify. To set up an early
bird discount check the **Discounts by sign up date** box underneath
your regular fees in the fees section of your event configuration.
Create the discount set and add it to the fee table. To help you create
a discount set, a new fee table will appear toward the bottom of your
page, duplicating the original fee table shown in the screenshot below.
You can now edit the labels and fees to correspond to the discounts
offered for each of the original fee options.

You can create multiple date-based discount sets for an event. This may
be useful if you have a series of early bird dates that progressively
increase the cost of registration as the date of the event gets closer.

Discount sets and discounts via price sets are out-of-the-box CiviCRM
that allow you to do offer discounts based on sign up dates. If you want
to get more sophisticated, you can install the CiviDiscount extension.
This allows you to give a variety of discounts, using things like
Discount codes, discounts based on membership status, and so on. See
*CiviDiscount* documentation for more detailed information.
