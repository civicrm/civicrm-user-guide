Manual event registration
=========================

This chapter covers how office staff can register people for events
through the admin interface. It will show how to register an individual
participant manually, how to register multiple participants and how to
import registrations from an external source.

**Registering a Participant Manually**
--------------------------------------


Although CiviCRM helps alleviate data entry for event registration by
allowing your constituents to register directly through your website, it
also provides the ability to manually register contacts. Useful, for
example, if people want to register by phone or mail, or if you want to
register people on their behalf.

For example, when a person calls the office to register for an event,
the staff person who takes the call can:

1.  Enter the person's name in the Quick search box.
2.  Select the contact from the results.
3.  Click the Events tab on the caller's contact record.
4.  Add the person to the event.

The Events tab on a contact record, shown in the following screenshot,
displays a summary list of the contact's past event attendance and
provides a link for registering the contact for a new event.

There are two options for registering the contact:

-   **Add Event Registration**: for people who pay later, such as by
    sending a check or paying when they arrive at the event. 
-   **Submit Credit Card Event Registration**: for people paying
    immediately with a credit card. This option is available only if
    you've configured a payment processor that allows direct payments
    through your web site. If you are taking a registration over the
    phone you can ask them for their credit card information and enter
    it manually. 

The interface for both options is very similar, with the exception of
those fields that record payment details.

As you work through this form, certain sections of the page change to
reflect choices you have made. For example, when you choose the event
you are registering the contact for and select a participant role, the
form will automatically load predefined custom data fields that pertain
to those selections.

If the event selected is a paid event, you will see an event fees
section which has been defined in the event configuration details, and
an option to record the financial transaction details (Record Payment)
will be visible. This leads us to an important concept central to
CiviEvent (as well as other modules): event registration records in
CiviCRM are independent of, but can be related to, a financial
transaction. While this may seem confusing to organizations accustomed
to viewing event registrations as essentially a financial transaction,
it offers an important and valuable distinction.

An event registration communicates the contact's participation in the
organization's event. A corresponding financial transaction indicates
the monetary value associated with that participation. While related,
the two are distinct.

The distinction is best understood by considering the common scenario of
an organization waiving fees for a V.I.P., a speaker, or someone who
participating in the event in a limited way. In such cases, you want to
register the individuals but may not want to create an associated
financial transaction.CiviCRM respects this distinction by recording
the event registration record under the Events tab, recording the
financial record under the Contributions tab, and then creating a link
between the two records.

If the event is a paid event, click the **Record Payment** checkbox and
enter information in the transaction fields that are displayed. This
process essentially links together the event registration and the
contribution record for this contact. After recording the registration,
you will be able to view the event registration record and see the
related contribution record at the bottom (see screenshot). If you do
not select the Record Payment check box, only a registration record will
be created.

### **Registering a participant paying only a deposit (partial payment)**

If you are registering a participant manually, you can enter a payment
amount less than the event fees, then make one or more additional
payments later on until the fee is paid in full.  

During the manual registration you enter the the amount actually being
paid at this time in the Total Amount field in the Payment Information
region. This sets both the **Event status** and the status for the
linked contribution to **Partially paid.**

![image](../img/z-sprint14-initial-partial-payment.png) 

The expectation is that additional payment(s) will be made until the
full event fee has been paid, so a **Partially paid** registration is
included in the participant total in the same way as a **Pending from
pay later** registration.

To make an additional payment on this registration:

1.  Go to the registrant's contact record.
2.  Click on the **Events** tab on that record.
3.  Click on **more** on the far right of the partially paid event
    record.
4.  Select **Record Payment.** 
5.  For a payment using a credit card select **submit credit card
    payment,** otherwise complete the payment details as required.

![image](../img/z_sprint14_RecordEventPayment.png)

You can make more than one additional payment. When the event fee has
been paid in full the Event status will automatically change to
**Registered** (although you can override this by choosing a different
status option when you make the last payment) and the status of the
linked contribution will automatically change to **Completed**.

Looking at this from an accounting perspective, when the registration is
created, the event fee is added to accounts receivable. Each partial
payment is then added as a separate line item until the fee is paid in
full.

Note that on the event registration and the linked contribution the
displayed amount will always be the full event fee. You can see how much
is owing by choosing to **view** the event registration. Selecting **›› view payments** (under the **Total Paid** amount) will display a
summary of each payment.

##Mass Registrations

CiviEvent offers the time-saving feature of registering multiple
contacts for an event at one time (or as a "batch"). Returning to the
youth leadership workshop scenario, Arts in Action anticipate a high
rate of attendance from participants at the previous workshop. The staff
perform a search to find previous participants and mass register them,
setting each individual's participate status to "pending". The list of
pending contacts is then used to call or email people to see if they are
coming. If the person says they will attend, the event organizer can
change the person's status from "pending" to "registered".

### Steps for Mass registration:

1.  Search for the set of contacts you are interested in (Arts in Action
    would navigate to **Search > Find Participants** to search for all
    participants at the previous workshop). 
2.  On the search results page, either choose **select all** or put a
    check mark next to each contact you are interested in. A sample
    search results page appears in the following screen-shot.  
    
![MassRegistration](../img/CiviCRM-CiviEvent-MassRegistration-en.png "MassRegistration")
    
  
3.  From the actions list just above the search results, choose **Add
    Contacts to Event** then click **Go.**
4.  Choose the event you would like to register participants for. Note
    that you cannot currently register participants en masse for past
    events. 
5.  Complete the registration form, choosing the appropriate action
    choices for this set of people, such as setting the Participant
    Status to pending. Choices made here will be applied to all contacts
    in this set. 
6.  Click **Save**.

### **Limitations of mass registrations**

The action choices you make (in Step 3) are applied uniformly to the
entire set of selected contacts. To work around this limitation, do a
mass registration several times, each time choosing the desired action
choices for that set of contacts. For example, you might mark one set of
contacts you plan to call and invite with a Participant Status of
"pending", then add another set of contacts to the event, such as event
leaders you know will attend, with a Participant Status of
"registered". 

You cannot do mass registration of participants for events in the past.


You cannot apply contribution information, such as a pay later
contribution or a credit card transaction, in a batch action. Therefore,
mass registration is best for free events or for contacts who are not
required to pay a fee at this point. You can always add payment details
for individual contacts later on.  

Importing Registrations 
---------------------------

Importing registration information is a quick way to add a bunch of
registrations to the event. The data to be imported must be available in
a comma-separated values (CSV) file. If the majority of the contacts are
already in CiviCRM, it may be faster to do a mass registration action as
mentioned earlier in this chapter. 

The import tool for participants is similar to that of contacts, but
there are some pre-requisites which must be met before running the
import. Firstly, participants cannot be imported unless the Individuals
already exist in the database as contacts. If you need to
import participants for contacts that are not yet available, run a
contact import first, preferably including a unique external identifier
(most often an ID assigned by the database or application you are
importing records from). There are two ways to match a participant to a
contact:

-   Use the external ID of the contact by including the ID in a column
    of the CSV file (if this ID was not imported with contacts, but you
    have them on record, a second contact import could be run to update
    this field, after which you may import participants).
-   Alternatively, you can match participants to contacts based on your
    contact de-dupe rules, e.g. through including the first name, last
    name and email address of the individual against each contact in the
    file. If a contact matches these three fields, the event
    participation will be assigned to it. 

### Preparing your data

When preparing your data import it is helpful to know what fields are
required for Import. You'll want to be sure that these fields are
included in your CSV import file. Below is a list of the required
fields. Please note that the fields marked **(Match to
Contact)**indicated that only one of those options must be included for
import. You do not need all of those fields to be included.

-   **Contact ID (Match to Contact)**
-   **Email (Match to Contact)**
-   **Event ID**
-   **External Identifier (Match to Contact)**
-   **Participant Status**



###Steps for importing registrations

1.  From the navigation menu, go to **Events > Import Participants**.
2.  Browse to the data file on your local computer.
3.  Select the appropriate contact type, date format and other options,
    and click **Continue**.
4.  Match the fields of your CSV file to the CiviCRM fields.
5.  If this is something you may repeat in the future, check the
    **Save** this field mapping box.
6.  **Preview** and **Save**.
