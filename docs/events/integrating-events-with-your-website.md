Integrating events with your website
====================================

Listing your events on your website, or on other organisations'
websites, is a great way to promote your events and attract registrants.
Below are a few suggestions of how you can integrate your events into
your website.

To get the link of the registration page of your event navigate
to **Events > Manage Events** and then click **Event Links. **You will
see a few different links in that menu. The two most useful are the link
to the event info page and the event registration page (the registration
page is also linked from the info page). Copy the URL for the event
page. You can then link to this page from anywhere in your website.

Note that in Joomla! you can link to your event by following these
steps:

### 

1.  Go into the Joomla! control panel
2.  Choose **Menu Manager > *Your menu name***
3.  Click **New**
4.  Expand **CiviCRM > CiviCRM Events** and click the **Event Info**
    item
5.  Choose the event from the **Select an Event** list on the right side
    of the page
6.  Click **Save**.

In WordPress you can also use the CiviCRM icon 'shortcode' to insert the
event registration form into the Page or Post

In Drupal, the **views** module gives many options for displaying lists
of content, including the ability to create an automatically updating
lists of upcoming events. Have a look at *Integrating with Drupal* in
the *Website integration* chapter for more details. 

**RSS feed for all upcoming events**
------------------------------------

This lets visitors subscribe to all your events in the RSS feed reader
of their choice. Many website management systems also allow a website to
subscribe to any RSS feed and present the information within their
layout.

1.  Navigate to **Events > Manage Events**.  
2.  Click on the orange and white square icon on the top right of the
    page.
3.  Copy the URL to share or embed into your website.
