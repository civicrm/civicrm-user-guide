Repeating Events
================

You can set an Event to repeat on a certain day and time with a specific
end date and include dates to exclude from the repetition.

To access the **Repeat Events** screen go to **Manage Events**, then
under the **Configure** select **Repeat** from the dropdown.

Once you are in the **Repeat Event Screen** you must specify the
Repeating intervals (in hours, days, weeks, months, or years), and Event
end date and occurrence end date. However it is recommended you specify
the Repetition Start Date and Excluded Dates.

**Note:** If you would like your Scheduled Reminders to repeat, make
sure you have setup Scheduled Reminders on the Event that you are
repeating, you can edit this later. It is also recommend that you do not
setup your reminders to repeat on specific days, but rather have them
sent two weeks or a few days before the Event.

Once you have filled out all the appropriate fields click
**Save,**to save your selection**.**You will have a popup window that
will prompt you to **Continue** with your selection.
