# Tokens and mail merge

## Overview

You can use data in your CiviCRM database to set up mail merged communications both for emails and printed materials such as letters and mailing labels. The mail merging functionality relies on "tokens", which represent fields in your database. For example, use the Postal Greeting token to include a customized greeting for each recipient in your PDF letters. Most contact fields, including custom fields you've created, are available as mail merge tokens.

## Basic contact data tokens {:#contact-data}

If you want each email to address the person by first name after "Dear,"
you would type a space and then click on **Insert Tokens** at the top
right of the HTML Format field.

![Screenshot of the New Email screen with the token list expanded.](/img/Tokens-4.5.png)

The popup that appears enables you to
find the appropriate token by typing "First name" in the box and choose
the token that corresponds. Click Close and you will see that your
message now reads "Dear {firstname}." When the email is sent, the
appropriate first name will be inserted into each message. Browse the
Inset Tokens pop-up for a complete list of contact data tokens,
including any of the custom fields that have been created for your site.

## Organizational tokens {:#organization}

In addition to basic contact data, 
you can also insert standard organization information, such as "Domain
(organizational) address," which displays the address of your
organization as defined at **Administer > Communications >
Organization Address and Contact Info**.

## Special tokens available for emails {:#email}

Some additional tokens are available for use in emails.

!!! note
    In the HTML format editing area, tokens that generate URLs (links) need to be placed in the URL field of the Link creation screen. Otherwise, they will display as text and not a clickable link in the email client of the recipient.

### Action tokens {:#actions}

You can also insert action tokens, such as opt-out, unsubscribe and
forwarding tokens. These tokens insert links to take the specified
action; in order to display the links properly in HTML messages, you'll
need to add the proper link tags using the Source icon in the editor.

### Required opt-out tokens for mass emails {:#opt-out}

You are required to include a token for either opt-out OR
unsubscribe, as well as the organizational (domain) address token in
every CiviMail mailing. These can be placed directly in the body of your
mailing body, or you can put them in the mailing header or footer. If
your organization has developed a standard mailing footer, just include
these tokens in the footer so that folks don't have to think about them
each time they create a new mailing.

In general, including click-able unsubscribe and opt-out links are a bit
friendlier for recipients (as opposed to the reply-to via email method).
You can also provide both options.

Additionally, some tokens are only available for mass mailings, such as the
token to provide a link to a message stored online.

### Checksum tokens {:#checksum}

A particularly useful token is the checksum. The checksum allows you to
give people links to contribution forms, profiles, petitions, and event
registration forms that are pre-filled with information that is already
in their contact record. This saves your constituents the hassle of filling out forms and
increases the chances they will take action (e.g., donate, sign up for
an event, sign the petition). It can also be a simple way to keep your
data current by asking people to review and update their contact
information.

!!! caution
    For security purposes, checksum links only last for seven days, starting from the time the email is sent. To change this duration, go to **Administer > System Settings > Misc (Undelete, PDFs, Limits, Logging, Captcha, etc.)**.

Create a link in the CiviMail message that includes the checksum token `{contact.checksum}`. When people click on the special link, CiviCRM looks them up in the database and prefills any information on the contribution form or profile with any data that exists in their record.

**Checksum for Contribution Pages**: To send people to a contribution page use this path where `IDNUMBER` is the ID of your contribution page:

-   Drupal: `http://example.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`
-   Joomla!: `http://example.org/index.php?option=com_civicrm&task=civicrm/contribute/transact&reset=1&id=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`
-   WordPress: `http://wexample.org/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/contribute/transact&reset=1&id=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`

**Checksum for standard Profiles** (edit mode): To send people to a profile use this path where `IDNUMBER` is the ID of the Profile you want to send them to:

-   Drupal: `http://example.org/civicrm/profile/edit?reset=1&gid=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&id={contact.contact_id}`
-   Joomla!: `http://example.org/index.php?option=com_civicrm&task=civicrm/profile/edit&reset=1&gid=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&id={contact.contact_id}`
-   WordPress:`http://example.org/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/profile/edit&reset=1&gid=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&id={contact.contact_id}`

**Checksum for Event Registration Pages**: To send people to an event registration page use this path where `IDNUMBER` is the ID of your event:

-   Drupal: `http://example.org/civicrm/event/register?reset=1&id=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`
-   Joomla!: `http://example.org/index.php?option=com_civicrm&task=civicrm/event/register&reset=1&id=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`
-   WordPress: `http://example.org/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/event/register&reset=1&id=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`

**Checksum for Petition Signature Pages**: To send people to sign a Petition, use this path where `IDNUMBER` is the ID of your petition:

-   Drupal: `http://example.org/civicrm/petition/sign?reset=1&sid=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`
-   Joomla!: `http://example.org/index.php?option=com_civicrm&task=civicrm/petition/sign&reset=1&sid=IDNUMBER&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`
-   WordPress: `http://example.org/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/petition/sign&sid=IDNUMBER&reset=1&{contact.checksum}&cid={contact.contact_id}`

## Custom tokens {:#custom}

Developers can create custom tokens which can, for example, display the total amount of contributions from a contact. See the Developer Guide for more info about [custom tokens](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/framework/civimail/#tokens). 

## Smarty in mail templates {:#smarty}

Mail templates use Smarty to include variables, tokens & functions. A more thorough tutorial can be found at [http://www.smarty.net/manual](http://www.smarty.net/manual).

!!! warning "System administrator required"
    For Smarty to work you must add (or modify) the following line to your `civicrm.settings.php` file located under `sites/default/` for Drupal and `administrator/components/com_civicrm` for Joomla.

    ```php
    define('CIVICRM_MAIL_SMARTY', 1);
    ```

Tips

* To make CiviCRM tokens available to Smarty functions, you'll need to use the `{capture}` function as follows:

    ```smarty
    {capture assign=first_name}{contact.first_name}{/capture}
    Dear {$first_name|default:Friend},
    {if $first_name}
      Hello, {$first_name}, how are you?
    {/if}
    ```

* You also need to use `{capture}` for custom fields. For example, if `{contact.custom_16}` is a Yes/No field designating a membership as a gift, and `{contact.custom_17}` is a text field with the name of the gift giver, then the following will print a line to that effect in a PDF letter:

    ```smarty
    {capture assign=gift}{contact.custom_16}{/capture}
    
    {if $gift == Yes}
      This membership is a gift from {contact.custom_17}.
    {/if}
    ```

* Another possibility is to create if/then logic for your mail
merge. This is done using the smarty template language as described here
[http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.function.if.tpl](http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.function.if.tpl).
