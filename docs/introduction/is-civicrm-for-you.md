# Is CiviCRM for You?

This chapter will help you to decide whether CiviCRM is the right tool
for your organisation.

CiviCRM is powerful software and has the potential to help your
organisation reach its goals - but it won't be the right choice for
every organisation. Here are some ways that you can find out whether
CiviCRM is right for your organisation:

-   read the book! (you might be doing that right now)
-   identify your organisation needs
-   talk to others who use CiviCRM
-   read [case studies about how similar organizations use CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/case-studies/)
-   talk to a CiviCRM consultant
-   play with [one of many free CiviCRM demonstration sites](https://civicrm.org/demo)
-   download and install [a test CiviCRM database ](https://civicrm.org/download) for free
-   Try [CiviCRM Spark](https://civicrm.org/spark) and easily get your own installation of CiviCRM up-and-running in minutes, starting from $9.50 a month. CiviCRM Spark is ideal for testing and trialing CiviCRM, or for on-going use by smaller organizations and activities with up to 2,000 contacts.

## Talking to others who use CiviCRM

If you know of another organisation that uses CiviCRM, talk to them
about their experience. Obviously the more similar they are to your
organisation, the better. If you don't know anyone that is using
CiviCRM, contact a [CiviCRM Expert](https://civicrm.org/partners-contributors), look at [case studies on CiviCRM.org](https://civicrm.org/case-studies/), or try your local non-profit technology mailing list.

The [CiviCRM StackExchange](https://civicrm.stackexchange.com/)
is a very good place to both ask and get answers to questions.
Try to formulate your question separately before posting and submit it 
as concisely as possible - trying as much as possible to use the names 
and terms used within CiviCRM (as opposed to those used by your business
model). This can improve the service you receive from the forums 
considerably! 
Stack Exchange questions are answered by volunteers, so the easier it is for them to understand, the more quickly the answers will come.
If you wish to ask questions or contribute to the discussions you must 
register first.

## Talking to CiviCRM Consultants

Another option to help you understand CiviCRM is to make use of a
professional. The CiviCRM website lists [professional vendors and
consultants](http://civicrm.org/providers) that can walk you through CiviCRM, and
there are many others; you may find a local website company who has
experience with CiviCRM. Consider hiring a consultant for a day to
discuss with you how CiviCRM could help your organisation.
