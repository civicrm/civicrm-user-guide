The SMS activity types are "Inbound SMS", "Mass SMS" and "SMS delivery".

You can then filter by SMS activity type and further by:

-   message status (e.g. completed/scheduled)
-   date and time
-   which group or tag the recipient is in
-   and characteristics of the recipients themselves, such as their name
    and location.
