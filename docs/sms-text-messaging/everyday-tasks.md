# Everyday tasks

Here we assume that you have already configured an SMS provider in
CiviCRM, and are now ready to either test sending an SMS, or engage with
your contacts. If you have yet to set up an SMS gateway, please read
"Set-up" first.

## Sending text messages

SMS messages can be sent to mailing lists or the results of an advanced
search for bulk SMS blasting, or a selection of individuals chosen
manually.

### Messages to a few individuals

If you wish to send a text message to an existing individual, open the
contact's profile, click the "Actions" button and select the option
"Send SMS". You can also create an SMS in the activities tab of a
contact from the "- new activity -" drop-down menu.

A new page will now appear in which to write your message:

-   **From**: choose the SMS provider you would like to send a message
    from.
-   **To**: this field will automatically populate with the mobile
    number of the contacts you selected on the previous screen, however,
    you can add further recipients by typing their name after the first
    number, and selecting a name from the suggestion list. Note that
    contacts without mobile numbers will not appear in the list (the
    phone number type must be "Mobile").
-   **Name the SMS**: this will appear as the SMS activity against the
    recipient's profiles, so giving it a name appropriate to the subject
    will help differentiate it from others later (e.g. "Change of email
    address request").
-   **Use Template**: if an SMS template has been created in the past,
    you may insert it here to save time (for more information, see
    "Set-up" in the "Email" chapter).
-   **Plain-Text Format**: here you may enter up to 160 characters of
    text for the message content. As with emails, [tokens](/common-workflows/tokens-and-mail-merge.md) can also be
    inserted to pull information about the contact into the message
-   **Save as New Template**: message written, if you wish to re-use the
    text regularly at a later date, you can save it as a template to
    save time later.

Finally, once the SMS has been sent, a confirmation message will appear
and an SMS activity will be posted against the recipient's contact
profile. To view this, open the contact, go to the "Activity" tab and
browse the list for an activity of the type "Text Message (SMS)". Click
"View" in the last column to see more details, including the message
content and campaign.

### Mass SMS messaging

Alternatively, you might want to send a personalised SMS to many people
at once. Before you start to write your message however, you will need
to have a list of recipients. If the message is a one-time affair, you
can run an advanced search for the criteria your participants must fall
into, select some or all of the contacts in the results list and choose
"Send SMS to Contacts" in the "Actions" drop-down menu. Please note that
the activity type this method creates will be "Text Message (SMS).

Otherwise should you wish to send bulk text messages to the same group
of contacts on a regular basis, you can use a mailing list. If you
haven't built one before, or would like to refresh your memory, read the
chapter "Setup" in the email section.

To begin writing a bulk SMS, go to: **Mailings** > **New SMS**. There
will three steps to complete:

1.  **Naming your SMS and selecting recipients**: first give the text
    message a name. This will appear as the SMS activity against every
    recipient's contact profile, so giving it a clear subject will help
    identify the content later. You will then need to select your
    recipients, so move the mailing lists you wish to include from the
    "include groups" box on the left, to the right using the "Add"
    button. You can also specify groups you do not want to include;
    contacts who fall into both groups will be not be sent a message
    (e.g. they may have already received a similar SMS under the group
    you have chosen not to include). Click Next.

2.  **SMS Content**: before writing the message, select an available SMS
    Provider and decide whether to use an existing mailing template for
    the content of your SMS (see "Setup in the Email chapter).
    
    The message content can either be written manually in the "Compose
    On-Screen" section, or uploaded from a text file, however, bear in
    mind that the character limit for both is 160 (this is the length of
    one text message). You may also insert [tokens](/common-workflows/tokens-and-mail-merge.md) to personalise the SMS
    by 'pulling' information about each contact into the message.
    Once written, if you think
    you would like to reuse the message later, tick the check box "Save
    as New Template" before going to the next screen.

3.  **Schedule or Send**: you now have the option to send the message
    immediately, or schedule it to be sent automatically at a future
    date and time. If you do not wish to do either at the moment, you
    can click "Continue Later" to save your progress and make the
    decision later. To return to the message, go to **Mailings** >
    **Draft and Unschedule Mailings**, tick the option "Is SMS" and
    click "Search". A list of unsent text messages will appear - simply
    click "continue" against the message you wish to complete.
    
    Finally, you can click on the "Preview SMS" banner at the bottom to
    check the content, or hit "Submit Mass SMS" to send your
    message.![image](/img/CiviCRM_Bulk-SMS_schedule-or-send.png)
