What is SMS?
============

SMS stands for Short Message, or Short Messaging Service, and is simply
the text messages your mobile phone may send and receive on a daily
basis. CiviCRM can handle the sending and receiving of these messages
from within the system, providing you with an extra means of making and
tracking communication with your constituents, other than email.

Some of the use-cases for this include:

-   Disseminating information to areas where mobile and landline
    internet access is either unavailable or unstable.
-   Collecting information/responses from remote areas
-   Rolling out an SMS marketing campaign
-   Distributing alerts and reminders
-   Sending a note to event participants (e.g. a meeting) that the
    location or time has changed at the last minute
