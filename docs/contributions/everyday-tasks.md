Everyday Tasks
==============

This chapter explains how to perform some common CiviContribute tasks.

Viewing the CiviContribute dashboard
------------------------------------

The CiviContribute main page or dashboard summarises the contributions
made, including lists of contributions received in the current month to
date, year to date, and cumulatively since inception (i.e. all
contribution records in your CiviCRM installation). This allows you to
easily browse contributions that have been recorded automatically or
added manually. The dashboard also provides buttons to manage and add
contribution pages.

Different layouts are available for viewing summaries. The following
screenshot shows the most recent contribution to a campaign using the
Table Layout tab:

![ContactSummary1a](/img/CiviCRM-CiviContribute-EveryDayTasks-ContactSummary1a-en.png "ContactSummary1a")




You can also view bar or pie charts to compare contribution totals
across months of a given year and across years by clicking on the Chart
Layout tab.

![ContactSummary1b](/img/CiviCRM-CiviContribute-EveryDayTasks-ContactSummary1b-en.png "ContactSummary1b")

Finally, you can add any number of contribution report instances to your
personal CiviCRM Dashboard. These might include a bar chart summary of
year-to-date contributions by Financial Type or month, a list of the top
10 donors, etc. Refer to the *Reports* section for details on adding
reports ("dashlets") to your personal dashboard

Adding contributions manually
-----------------------------

When your organisation receives a contribution from a contact, you can
add it to their record. This will be done automatically if the payment
is made through CiviCRM (for example, a membership or event fee made
with an online registration) but offline payments will need to be
manually recorded to ensure that reports generated from CiviCRM are
accurate. 

If the donor does not already exist in the database, you need to first
create a new contact record for them;*see the chapter on Contacts in the
Basic Concepts section of this book for information on how to do this.*
Once the record is created, you can then enter the contribution.

To manually enter a contribution for a contact in your database:

1.  Find the contact's record using one of the contact search tools, for
    example **Search > Find Contacts**. 
2.  Select the contact's **Contributions** tab.
3.  Click **Record Contribution (Check, Cash, EFT...)**. Alternatively,
    if you have set up a payment processor that allows credit card
    transactions directly on your site, you may select the **Submit
    Credit Card Contribution** option and process the payment
    immediately. 
4.  Complete the new contribution form. The following screenshot shows
    the offline contribution (i.e. contributions via check, cash, EFT,
    etc.) form. If you selected to record a credit card contribution,
    the credit card form is almost identical except for the
    payment-related
    fields.![](/img/New%20Contribution%20by%20Contact.png) 
     
5.  Record the Financial Type, amount, received date (the default is the
    current day), receipt date (shown on the receipt generated by the
    system), and status (the default is Completed). Any custom fields
    for contributions will also appear on this form.
6.  The **Soft Credit To** field works with personal campaign pages
    (PCPs) that harness your contacts' help for campaigns. When you
    enter a donation manually on the contribution form for the
    contributor, you can assign a soft credit to the owner of the PCP.
    There is more information about PCPs and campaign fundraising pages
    in the Set-up chapter of the CiviContribute section.
7.  The **Additional Details** section near the bottom of the screen
    offers other options including adding a note about the contribution
    and entering the date when a thank-you letter was sent.
8.  The last two sections allow you to enter whether the contribution
    was in honor of someone else (**Honoree Information**) and whether
    there is a premium associated with the contribution (**Premium
    Information**).
9.  Click **Save**, or **Save and New** if you are entering further
    contributions.

If you find that you are entering more than a few contributions at the
same time, consider using the **Bulk Data Entry** method described later
in this chapter. 

Finding contributions
---------------------

To View the Find Contributions screen, go to Contributions > Find
Contributions

![](/img/Finding%20Contribution.png)

You can search based on a number of criteria, such as date range,
amount, contribution status etc. Contributions must match all specified
criteria in order to be returned, so the more criteria you enter, the
narrower the search will be. For example, searching for the Financial
Type "donation" and the date range "January 1st to May 31st" will return
contributions that meet both criteria. Relative date ranges such as
"Last Month" or "Last Year" are often quite useful.

The search criteria shown above are also available from Advanced Search,
which means you can get results as a list of contacts OR contributions.
Advanced Search allows you to save a query as a smart group - and you
can also filter your results with additional contact criteria including
donor addresses and demographics ("Show me all contacts who have
contributed more than $100 last year AND who live in California"). 

The results screen from a search displays the the total amount for the
results returned for that search, the number of contributions, and the
average amount per contribution in addition to the subset of records
resulting from the search:

![](/img/Batch%20Update%20Contribution%20Via%20Profile.png)

You can select an action to perform from the - actions - menu once you
select all or a subset of records. The "actions" menu allows you to:

-   **Batch Update Contributions Via Profile**: this is useful if you
    want to update a large number of contributions' thank-you date at
    once, for example. You need to create the profile you want to
    use*before* you perform the search and batch update (see the the
    chapter Profiles in the Configuration section for more information
    about creating profiles).

-   **Delete Contributions**: this removes contributions entirely from
    the system, as if they had never been entered in the first place.
    Editing contribtions and updating their status to canceled provides
    a better audit trail, but there may be situations where you do want
    to delete, such as a contribution entered on the wrong contact's
    record.

-   **Export Contributions**: because this search is
    contribution-centric, it does not recognise if contributions come
    from the same contact. Therefore, if one contact has multiple
    contributions that fit the search criteria, that contact will appear
    as multiple rows when you export your spreadsheet. If you want to do
    searches that return one result per contact, use the contact
    advanced search.

-   **Print or Email Contribution Receipts**: this allows you to create
    a PDF file of all the receipts in the search, or email the receipts
    to the associated donors. See "Sending thank you letters" below for
    more information.

-   **Send Email to Contacts**: send an email to all or selected contacts
found in the search.

-   **Send Thank-you Letters for Contributions**: create a custom PDF letter
for each of the contributions selected, with the option to update the
receipt or thank you date for each.

-   **Update Pending Contribution Status**: update the contribution
    status of all or selected contacts who have contributed online. This
    action only works with online contributions, and the same
    contribution status will be applied to all the contributions
    selected for updating.

Batch Entry of Contribution, Membership or Pledge Payments
----------------------------------------------------------

The **Batch Data Entry** feature allows you to enter contribution,
membership or pledge payments using a batch entry grid input screen
where you can use the ‘autocopy’ icons at the top of each column to
quickly fill in field values. It eases data entry when you have a lot of
payments to record at one time. It also lets you verify the total
amount and count of items in the batch against the payments recorded on
your deposit slip(s).

Each batch contains either contribution payments, membership payments or
pledge payments. During the batch data entry you can create new contacts
on the fly. You can save the batch and return later to continue
entering payments. If you have the appropriate permissions, you can
also edit the total amount and count of items in the definition of the
batch if needed. 

Here’s a simple workflow for bulk data entry: 
 
**1. Create a new batch for data entry**

Create a new batch to hold the multiple payments you want to record:

From the menu, click on **Contributions > Batch Data Entry**or
**Membership > Batch Data Entry****.**

![](/img/New%20Data%20Entry.png)

Enter the following information:

-   **Batch Name**: CiviCRM will create a default batch name ("Batch N" + open date), which you can edit (required field)
-   **Type**: select the type of payment, e.g. Contribution, Membership
    or Pledge Payment. This selects the appropriate reserved profile to
    view in the batch entry grid screen (Contribution Batch Entry
    profile, Membership Batch Entry profile or Pledge Payment Batch
    Entry profile)
-   **Status**: the default will be “Open” (note: once a batch has a
    “closed status”, the batch will no longer be editable)
-   **Number of items**: total of payment items in the batch (required
    field)
-   **Total amount**: total amount of all the payment items in the batch
    (required field) 

You can later edit or delete Batch information, by going back to the
**Bulk Data Entry**screen, then clicking on **Edit** or **Delete** next
the batch you want.

![](/img/CiviCRM-Contributions-everydaytasks-batches-lists.jpg)

**2. Enter Contribution, Membership or Pledge Payments (check, cash,
EFT, etc.)** 

Once you enter information about the batch, you can begin entering
payments on each
line.![](../_edit/static/CiviCRM-Contributions-everydaytasks-batchentrycontrib.jpg)

There are eight fields that appear for all batches.

The **Contact** column is included for all batch types. In that column
you can:

-   start entering the name of an existing contact and CiviCRM will
    return a list of potential contact names for you to select, OR 
-   create a new contact by clicking the drop-down box for “-create new
    contact-“ and selecting the type of contact you want to create: **New
    Individual**, **New Organization**, or **New Household** and enter the
    information about the contact here. 
    Note: If contact information such as phone number or email address
are included in the grid profile, those values will be populated for
an existing contact and can be updated as needed. 
-   **Type:**This is the Financial Type and is called that in membership
batches to distinguish it from Membership Type**.**
-   **Amount**
-   **(Payment) Status**
-   **Received – Date and Time**
-   **Send Receipt:** check the box if you want to send a receipt via email
-   **Soft Credit**
-   **Soft Credit Type**

When batch entering contribution payments the additional fields in the
standard profile are:

-   **Source** : enter text that describes the source of the payment
-   **Paid by**: enter the type of payment vehicle, e.g. cash, check,
    EFT, etc.
-   **Check Number**: if paid by check
-   **Invoice ID**

When batch entering membership payments you can choose to add a new
membership or renew an existing membership. The extra fields in the
standard profile are:

-   **Type**: For a new membership you will select the organisation and
    type of membership. For the renewal you can change the membership
    type.
-   **Member Since:**When you open the batch entry form, this is
    populated with the current date If you choose to renew a membership
    it will change to display the start date for that membership. It can
    be edited as needed.
-   **Start Date**(reserved): This is blank. You only need to fill in
    this field if you want the start date to be other than the default.
-   **End Date(reserved)**: If this is left empty, CiviCRM will use the
    membership rules to set it to the correct date.
-   **Source**: Enter text that describes the source of the payment.
-   **Paid by**: Enter the type of payment vehicle, e.g. cash, check,
    EFT, etc.
-   **Check Number**: Enter if paid by check.
-   **Invoice ID**

When batch entering pledge payments you can assign the payment to any of
the pending pledges for that contact. If you have the appropriate
permissions, you can also alter the amount or schedule for the pledge
payment. (Click on **adjust payment amount**next to the **Amount**
field.)The extra fields in the standard profile are:

-   **Source**: enter text that describes the source of the payment
-   **Paid by**: enter the type of payment vehicle, e.g. cash, check,
    EFT, etc.
-   **Check Number**: if paid by check
-   **Invoice ID 
    **

**3. Validate and Process the Batch Totals or Save the Batch**

You can enter all transactions for the batch in one session, or simply
save the batch and complete the data entry at a later time. 
 
If you want to continue entering information into this batch at a later
time, click **Save & Continue Later**.

To find and add/edit more transactions into the batch later:

-   From the menu, click on **Contributions > Batch Data Entry** or
    click on **Membership > Batch Data Entry**, then click on**Enter
    Records** next to the batch you want

Then continue entering more transactions in the batch 

Once you are finished entering payments into a batch, click**Validate &
Process the Batch**. The status of the batch will be set to
“**Closed**” and will available for searches and reporting later.

If the total amount or count of items do not match the values you
entered when you created the Batch, you will be alerted when closing if
the count or total don't match. In this case, you either:

-   You can override the entered count and total by clicking**Ignore
    Mismatch & Process the Batch?** button, in which case the batch
    values are updated to match the transactions in the batch, and then
    the status of the batch will be set to “**Closed**”, OR
-   You can continue entering or editing the payments for the batch,
    then **Validate & Process the Batch** again. 

![](/img/CiviCRM-Contributions-everydaytasks-ignoremismatchbatch.jpg)

**4. Search for contribution, membership or pledge payments in verified
and processed batches** 
 
You can search for contribution or membership payments in verified and
processed batches in a several ways: 

-   From the menu, click on **Searches > Find Contributions** , enter
    criteria for the contributions, and under **Batch Name**, select the
    batch you want;
-   From the menu, click on **Searches > Advanced Search**, enter
    criteria about the contact, then open the Contributions area and
    enter any contribution criteria, and under **Batch Name**, select
    the batch you want;
-   From the menu, click on **Contributions > Batches** , then select
    **Closed** in the **Status**field;
-   From the menu, click on **Memberships > Batches** , then select
    **Closed** in the **Status** field;
-   From the menu, click on **Pledge Payments > Batches**, then
    select **Closed** in the **Status** field; 
-   From the menu, click **Reports > Create Reports from Templates**,
    then click **Contribution Report Detail**, enter your report
    criteria and under Set Filters area, next to**Batch Name**, select
    “**is one of**” or “**is not one of**” and select the name(s) of the
    batch(es) you want. 

Sending receipts and thank you letters
--------------------------------------

### Receipts

Donors making contributions through an online form will automatically
receive an email receipt for their payment, provided the option to send
them was selected during the configuration of the contribution page. If
you wish to manually send or re-send a receipt at a later date, you can
do so by either editing the contribution record against a contact and
ticking the option **Send Receipt?** (an email will be sent after you
click **Save**).

You can send receipts to multiple contacts at the same time through the
contributions search. Simply run a search, as above, and after selecting
the contacts you wish to send a receipt to, choose **Print or Email
Contribution Receipts** from the actions drop-down menu.
![](../_edit/static/CiviCRM_contributions_sendreceipts.png)

You will be given the option to  email the receipts or make PDF receipts
to post out to contributors.

![](/img/Print%20contribution%20receipt%20options.PNG) 

By default the emailing or creating PDF receipts will update the receipt
date for each contribution, but you can keep the existing receipt dates
if you need to. You can also choose to disregard the **Do not email/Do
not mai**l settings so that all selected contributors are sent a receipt

To find out how you can change the format of receipts, see the chapter
*Contributions > Set-Up.*

### Thank-you letters

Some organisations may wish to send thank-you letters to people who
donated to a particular campaign, advising them of the total amount
raised. Other organisations like to send one receipt to each contact at
the end of the fiscal year covering all tax-deductible donations made
during that year. Both of these scenarios and more can be accomplished
using the "Thank-you letters for Contributions" functionality. This
action is available from a search results screen displaying
contributions (rather than contacts). The steps involved are: 

1.  Use **Find Contributions** or use **Advanced Search** with **Display
    Results As** set to **Contributions** for your search. 
2.  Select the contributions for which you want thank-you letters or
    combined receipts. 
3.  Choose the action **Thank-you Letters for Contributions.** The
    following will be displayed: 
    ![](/img/Thank-you%20letters%20with%20text.PNG)
4.  Choose to **Update thank-you dates for these contributions** or
    **Update receipt dates for these contributions** as required. The
    current date will be entered into the appropriate field.**
    **
5.  There are three self-explanatory **Print and Email Options**: 
    -   Generate PDFs for printing (only) 
    -   Send emails where possible, generate printable PDFs for contacts
        who cannot receive emails
    -   Send emails where possible, generate printable PDFs for all
        contacts.

6.  Some people may have made more than one contribution. If you want
    to send one letter for each contribution then set **Group
    contributions by** to **"-no grouping-"**. Alternatively, you can
    choose to show contribution data for multiple contributions from the
    same contact in one location in the body of your letter. There are
    five "group by" " options.
7.  **Separator (grouped contributions)** only applies if you have
    chosen something other than **- no grouping -** for the
    contributions. These options will be discussed below in *Formatting
    for grouped contribution thank-you letters*. 
8.  Make sure to check the **Page Format** settings.
9.  You can use an existing template, create a new letter for one-off
    use, or create a new letter and save it as a new template. See
    *Tokens and mail merge* and *Postal mail communications* in the
    *Common Workflows* section for more information on creating
    letter templates.
10. When you click on **Make Thank-you Letters** the letters will be
    generated and a "Print PDF letter" activity will be created for each
    letter with the **Activity Subject** you have specified. 

### Grouped contribution thank-you letters

You can send end-of-fiscal-year giving statements/tax receipts to your contacts if you choose an option other than **-no grouping-** for the field **Group contributions by**.

In a standard CiviCRM installation, the letters that can be produced
when you group contributions are fairly rudimentary.

If you choose **Comma** as the **Separator** then the contribution
amounts and/or dates will follow one after the other separated by
commas. For example "Thank you for your generous donations of
{contribution.total_amount} received on {contribution.receive_date}
respectively." will become "Thank you for your generous donations of
$100.00, $150.00, $325.00 received on 1 January 2015, 5 March 2015,
16 May 2015 respectively."

If you choose **Table Cell** as the **Separator** then each contribution
instance will be placed in its own table column. For example:

![](/img/Thank-you%20letters%20as%20table%20template.PNG) 

will result in:

![](/img/Thank-you%20letters%20as%20table_1.PNG) 

This format works well if only a few contributions have been received
during the year, but the table will be wider than the page for monthly,
fortnightly or weekly donations.

In neither case can the total yearly contribution amount be included in
the letter. 
 
To include the total yearly contribution amount in the letter and to
produce a letter more suited to several contributions from the one
person, you (or your implementer/developer) will need to enable Smarty
functionality for you emails
([http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Smarty+in+mail+templates](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Smarty+in+mail+templates)).

Once that has been done the total yearly contribution amount can be
included in the letter using the token {$contribution_aggregate}.

For example, if the HTML source for your letter is:

```
<p>Dear {contact.first_name}</p> 
<p>Thank you for donating ${$contribution_aggregate} to help the arts during the 2014 financial year</p> 
<p>Your donation is tax deductible and the details are given below.</p> 
<p>with appreciation for your generosity,</p> 
<p>the CEO</p> 
  <table class="table" style="width: 500px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" align="left"> 
    <tbody> 
      <tr>
        <th>Date</th>
        <th>Amount</th>
        <th>Receipt Number</th></tr> 
    <!-- 
    {foreach from=$contributions item=contribution} {assign
    var="date" value=$contribution.receive_date|date_format:"%d %B
    %Y"} 
  --> 
      <tr> 
        <td>{$date}</td> 
        <td>{$contribution.total_amount}</td> 
        <td>{$contribution.id}</td> 
      </tr> 
   <!-- 
    {/foreach} 
  
 --></tbody> 
  </table>
```
then your letters will look like:
