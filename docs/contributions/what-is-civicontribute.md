# What is CiviContribute?

CiviContribute is the component that lets you record and report on financial
and in-kind contributions to your organization.  It allows you to:

-  accept donations and other financial or in-kind contributions
-  process membership signups and renewals
-  accept and manage events fees.
-  run specific fundraising campaigns
-  let your supporters fundraise for you through personalised campaign pages
-  quickly enter contribution and membership payments using "batches"
-  export batches of financial transactions to import to your accounting software
-  report and evaluate fundraising results and trends

Throughout CiviCRM, the term *contribution* refers to any financial
transaction or payment taking place in the system such as a donation,
event fee payment or membership fee payment and includes in-kind contributions.

## Scenario: Contributing to Leadership

A community arts group, Arts in Action, conducts leadership workshops
for youth under 25 throughout the year. They use CiviCRM extensively in
the planning and execution of these workshops, combining the CiviEvent
and CiviContribute components to make the administration of the
workshops as efficient as possible.

The workshops are funded in three ways: participant fees, local arts
funding, and donations. Most of the donations are from previous workshop
participants who have continued as Arts in Action constituents. Twice a
year a call for donations towards the workshops is sent out using
CiviMail, providing a link to a donations page on the site. Some donors
make recurring donations, while others make one-off donations. A
thank-you email and receipt is automatically sent to every donor when a
payment is successfully processed. All donations are tagged for the
workshops, so that Arts in Action staff can run reports showing total
workshop donations and look at individual contact records to see who has
donated.

Participants register and pay for the workshops via an online form.
There is a flat fee for registration, with additional fees for optional
workshops, food and lodging preferences. The participants make these
choices in the form and pay with a credit card. If they are not already
a contact within the database, a new record is created at the time of
registration, and the payment is recorded in that contact's contribution
record which is also linked to the workshop event.

Arts in Action allows participants to pay later, as many of the
participants do not have a credit card and need to pay in cash at the
workshop. CiviContribute distinguishes between an actual payment and a
commitment to pay, and this information is included in the registrants
report that is printed out and used on the day to check participant
attendance and payment. A computer at the registration desk at the
workshop is used to manually input cash and cheque payments to the
participant's contribution record.

Because Arts in Action has assessed that the most effective publicity
for the workshop is by word of mouth and participants bringing friends,
they also enable participants to forward the registration link to
friends via the "tell-a-friend" mechanism. After completing the
registration form, participants can easily forward it via email or
social networking platforms to their friends and colleagues who may also
be interested in attending.

After every workshop, the Arts in Action accountant generates a report
that shows the total income from each of the three sources for the
workshop, using a report template. She also tracks trends in donations
and ensures that the Board are aware of who the larger donors are. Key
statistics are displayed graphically on staff members' CiviCRM
dashboard.
