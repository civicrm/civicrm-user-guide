# Manual entry of contributions

Adding contributions manually
-----------------------------

When your organisation receives a contribution from a contact, you can
add it to their record. This will be done automatically if the payment
is made through CiviCRM (for example, a membership or event fee made
with an online registration) but offline payments will need to be
manually recorded to ensure that reports generated from CiviCRM are
accurate.

If the donor does not already exist in the database, you need to first
create a new contact record for them;*see the chapter on Contacts in the
Basic Concepts section of this book for information on how to do this.*
Once the record is created, you can then enter the contribution.

To manually enter a contribution for a contact in your database:

1.  Find the contact's record using one of the contact search tools, for
    example **Search > Find Contacts**.
2.  Select the contact's **Contributions** tab.
3.  Click **Record Contribution (Check, Cash, EFT...)**. Alternatively,
    if you have set up a payment processor that allows credit card
    transactions directly on your site, you may select the **Submit
    Credit Card Contribution** option and process the payment
    immediately.
4.  Complete the new contribution form. The following screenshot shows
    the offline contribution (i.e. contributions via check, cash, EFT,
    etc.) form. If you selected to record a credit card contribution,
    the credit card form is almost identical except for the
    payment-related
    fields.![image](../img/New%20Contribution%20by%20Contact.png)

5.  Record the Financial Type, amount, received date (the default is the
    current day), receipt date (shown on the receipt generated by the
    system), and status (the default is Completed). Any custom fields
    for contributions will also appear on this form.
6.  The **Soft Credit To** field works with personal campaign pages
    (PCPs) that harness your contacts' help for campaigns. When you
    enter a donation manually on the contribution form for the
    contributor, you can assign a soft credit to the owner of the PCP.
    There is more information about PCPs and campaign fundraising pages
    in the Set-up chapter of the CiviContribute section.
7.  The **Additional Details** section near the bottom of the screen
    offers other options including adding a note about the contribution
    and entering the date when a thank-you letter was sent.
8.  The last two sections allow you to enter whether the contribution
    was in honor of someone else (**Honoree Information**) and whether
    there is a premium associated with the contribution (**Premium
    Information**).
9.  Click **Save**, or **Save and New** if you are entering further
    contributions.

If you find that you are entering more than a few contributions at the
same time, consider using the **Bulk Data Entry** method described later
in this chapter.

Batch Entry of Contribution, Membership or Pledge Payments
----------------------------------------------------------

The **Batch Data Entry** feature allows you to enter contribution,
membership or pledge payments using a batch entry grid input screen
where you can use the ‘autocopy’ icons at the top of each column to
quickly fill in field values. It eases data entry when you have a lot of
payments to record at one time. It also lets you verify the total
amount and count of items in the batch against the payments recorded on
your deposit slip(s).

Each batch contains either contribution payments, membership payments or
pledge payments. During the batch data entry you can create new contacts
on the fly. You can save the batch and return later to continue
entering payments. If you have the appropriate permissions, you can
also edit the total amount and count of items in the definition of the
batch if needed.

Here’s a simple workflow for bulk data entry:

**1. Create a new batch for data entry**

Create a new batch to hold the multiple payments you want to record:

From the menu, click on **Contributions > Batch Data Entry**or
**Membership > Batch Data Entry****.**

![image](../img/New%20Data%20Entry.png)

Enter the following information:

-   **Batch Name**: CiviCRM will create a default batch name ("Batch N" + open date), which you can edit (required field)
-   **Type**: select the type of payment, e.g. Contribution, Membership
    or Pledge Payment. This selects the appropriate reserved profile to
    view in the batch entry grid screen (Contribution Batch Entry
    profile, Membership Batch Entry profile or Pledge Payment Batch
    Entry profile)
-   **Status**: the default will be “Open” (note: once a batch has a
    “closed status”, the batch will no longer be editable)
-   **Number of items**: total of payment items in the batch (required
    field)
-   **Total amount**: total amount of all the payment items in the batch
    (required field)

You can later edit or delete Batch information, by going back to the
**Bulk Data Entry**screen, then clicking on **Edit** or **Delete** next
the batch you want.

**2. Enter Contribution, Membership or Pledge Payments (check, cash,
EFT, etc.)**

Once you enter information about the batch, you can begin entering
payments on each
line.![image](../img/CiviCRM-Contributions-everydaytasks-batchentrycontrib.jpg)

There are eight fields that appear for all batches.

The **Contact** column is included for all batch types. In that column
you can:

-   start entering the name of an existing contact and CiviCRM will
    return a list of potential contact names for you to select, OR
-   create a new contact by clicking the drop-down box for “-create new
    contact-“ and selecting the type of contact you want to create: **New
    Individual**, **New Organization**, or **New Household** and enter the
    information about the contact here.
    Note: If contact information such as phone number or email address
are included in the grid profile, those values will be populated for
an existing contact and can be updated as needed.
-   **Type:**This is the Financial Type and is called that in membership
batches to distinguish it from Membership Type**.**
-   **Amount**
-   **(Payment) Status**
-   **Received – Date and Time**
-   **Send Receipt:** check the box if you want to send a receipt via email
-   **Soft Credit**
-   **Soft Credit Type**

When batch entering contribution payments the additional fields in the
standard profile are:

-   **Source** : enter text that describes the source of the payment
-   **Paid by**: enter the type of payment vehicle, e.g. cash, check,
    EFT, etc.
-   **Check Number**: if paid by check
-   **Invoice ID**

When batch entering membership payments you can choose to add a new
membership or renew an existing membership. The extra fields in the
standard profile are:

-   **Type**: For a new membership you will select the organisation and
    type of membership. For the renewal you can change the membership
    type.
-   **Member Since:**When you open the batch entry form, this is
    populated with the current date If you choose to renew a membership
    it will change to display the start date for that membership. It can
    be edited as needed.
-   **Start Date**(reserved): This is blank. You only need to fill in
    this field if you want the start date to be other than the default.
-   **End Date(reserved)**: If this is left empty, CiviCRM will use the
    membership rules to set it to the correct date.
-   **Source**: Enter text that describes the source of the payment.
-   **Paid by**: Enter the type of payment vehicle, e.g. cash, check,
    EFT, etc.
-   **Check Number**: Enter if paid by check.
-   **Invoice ID**

When batch entering pledge payments you can assign the payment to any of
the pending pledges for that contact. If you have the appropriate
permissions, you can also alter the amount or schedule for the pledge
payment. (Click on **adjust payment amount**next to the **Amount**
field.)The extra fields in the standard profile are:

-   **Source**: enter text that describes the source of the payment
-   **Paid by**: enter the type of payment vehicle, e.g. cash, check,
    EFT, etc.
-   **Check Number**: if paid by check
-   **Invoice ID
    **

**3. Validate and Process the Batch Totals or Save the Batch**

You can enter all transactions for the batch in one session, or simply
save the batch and complete the data entry at a later time.

If you want to continue entering information into this batch at a later
time, click **Save & Continue Later**.

To find and add/edit more transactions into the batch later:

-   From the menu, click on **Contributions > Batch Data Entry** or
    click on **Membership > Batch Data Entry**, then click on**Enter
    Records** next to the batch you want

Then continue entering more transactions in the batch

Once you are finished entering payments into a batch, click**Validate &
Process the Batch**. The status of the batch will be set to
“**Closed**” and will available for searches and reporting later.

If the total amount or count of items do not match the values you
entered when you created the Batch, you will be alerted when closing if
the count or total don't match. In this case, you either:

-   You can override the entered count and total by clicking**Ignore
    Mismatch & Process the Batch?** button, in which case the batch
    values are updated to match the transactions in the batch, and then
    the status of the batch will be set to “**Closed**”, OR
-   You can continue entering or editing the payments for the batch,
    then **Validate & Process the Batch** again.

**4. Search for contribution, membership or pledge payments in verified
and processed batches**

You can search for contribution or membership payments in verified and
processed batches in a several ways:

-   From the menu, click on **Searches > Find Contributions** , enter
    criteria for the contributions, and under **Batch Name**, select the
    batch you want;
-   From the menu, click on **Searches > Advanced Search**, enter
    criteria about the contact, then open the Contributions area and
    enter any contribution criteria, and under **Batch Name**, select
    the batch you want;
-   From the menu, click on **Contributions > Batches** , then select
    **Closed** in the **Status**field;
-   From the menu, click on **Memberships > Batches** , then select
    **Closed** in the **Status** field;
-   From the menu, click on **Pledge Payments > Batches**, then
    select **Closed** in the **Status** field;
-   From the menu, click **Reports > Create Reports from Templates**,
    then click **Contribution Report Detail**, enter your report
    criteria and under Set Filters area, next to**Batch Name**, select
    “**is one of**” or “**is not one of**” and select the name(s) of the
    batch(es) you want.


    Batch Entry of Contributions, Membership or Pledge Payments
    -------------------------------------------------------------

    The **Batches** feature allows you to enter multiple membership, pledge
    or contribution payments as well as add new contacts on the fly in a
    grid-style input screen. The fields of information that you see and want
    to collect in the batch entry input grid for **Batches** are determined
    by several CiviCRM reserved profiles. If you want to collect other
    kinds of information that are not currently included in these profiles,
    you will need to alter these profiles to reflect the fields you want to
    display.

    ### Configuring Profiles for Batch Entry of Contribution, Membership and Pledge Payments

    To alter the profile used when you want to create a new contact for an
    Individual, Household, or Organization while recording the contribution,
    update the reserved profiles called **New Individual, New Household**,
    or **New Organization** accordingly. To change the fields of
    information you want to collect for these contacts:

    -   Go to the menu and click **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Profiles**, then click on **Reserved Profiles** tab. Click on
        **Fields** next to called **New Individual, New Household**, or
        **New Organization**.
    -   You can then add, edit or rearrange the fields as you want to see
        them in the batch entry input grid.*To find out more about how to
        use profiles, see the chapter called “Profiles” in the “User
        Interface” section*.

    **TIP:** Reserved profiles for **New Individual, New Organization**,
    and **New Household**, are used in other areas of CiviCRM. Be aware
    that if you alter these profiles for use with **Batches**, these same
    changes you’ve made will also appear on other screens where you have the
    option to create a new contact inline.

    ![image](../img/CiviCRM-Contributions-SetUp-new-individual-profile.jpg)

    Above is CiviCRM’s default configuration of the New Individual profile,
    which is used when you select to create a new contact for an individual
    during batch entry of contributions or membership payments.

    To alter the profile of fields of information you want to collect for
    contributions or membership payments, you will need to update the
    reserved profiles called **Contribution Batch Entry** or **Membership
    Batch Entry**:

    -   Go to the menu and click **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Profiles**, then click on **Reserved Profiles** tab. Click on
        **Fields** next to **Contribution Batch Entry** profile or the
        **Membership Batch Entry** profile.
    -   You can then add, edit , or rearrange the fields in this profile,
        e.g. you may have other custom contribution fields you would like to
        display and collect information, and display in the batch entry
        input grid. *To find out more about how to use profiles, see the
        chapter called “Profiles” in the “User Interface” section*.

    ![image](../img/CiviCRM-Contributions-SetUp-contribution-batch-entry-profile.jpg)

    Above is CiviCRM’s default configuration for the Contribution Batch
    Entry profile, which is used when you record information about a
    contact’s contribution or pledge payment.



    ![image](../img/CiviCRM-Contributions-SetUp-membership-batch-entry-profile.jpg)

    Above is CiviCRM’s default configuration for the Membership Batch Entry
    profile, which is used when you record information about a contact’s
    membership payment.

    Importing contributions
    -----------------------

    If you have not imported data before, please refer to the chapter
    'importing data' first.

    When preparing your data import it is helpful to know what fields are
    required for Import. You'll want to be sure that these fields are
    included in your CSV import file. Below is a list of the required
    fields. Please note that the fields marked **(Match to
    Contact)**indicated that only one of those options must be included for
    import. You do not need all of those fields to be included.

    -   **Contact ID (Match to Contact)**
    -   **Email (Match to Contact)**
    -   **External Identifier (Match to Contact)**
    -   **Financial Type**
    -   **Total Amount**



    The import tool for contributions is similar to that of contacts, but
    there are some pre-requisites which must be met before running the
    import. Firstly, contributions cannot be imported unless the
    contributors already exist in the database as contacts. If you need to
    import contributions for contacts that are not yet available, run a
    contact import first, preferably including a unique external identifier
    (most often an ID assigned by the database or application you are
    importing records from). There are two ways to match a contribution to a
    contact:

    -   Use the external ID of the contact by including the ID in a column
        of the CSV file (if this ID was not imported with contacts, but you
        have them on record, a second contact import could be run to update
        this field, after which you may import contributions).
    -   Alternatively, you can match contributions to contacts based on your
        contact de-dupe rules, e.g. through including the first name, last
        name and email address of the donor against each contribution in the
        file. If a contact matches these three fields, the contribution will
        be assigned to it.

    Remember, CSV files must be less than 2MB in size. If the file size
    exceeds this, create multiple CSV files and distribute the data between
    them.
