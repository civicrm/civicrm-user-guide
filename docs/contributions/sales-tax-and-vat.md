# Sales tax and VAT

If your organization charges Sales Tax or VAT you should enable
this feature.

To enable Sales Tax/VAT go to
**Administer > CiviContribute > CiviContribute Component Settings** and check
the "Enable Tax and Invoicing" box.

In this screen you can set certain settings for Sales Tax/VAT as well:

-   Tax Term- this is a text field for what your organization wants to call
the relevant Sales Tax or VAT

-   Tax Display Settings - how does your organization want to display the
tax/VAT

    -   No breakdown, total only
    -   Shows as inclusive price- $120 (includes $20 tax)
    -   Shows as exclusive price - $100 + $20 tax

## Adding a Financial Account for Sales Tax/VAT

Once Sales Tax/VAT is enabled you need to create one or more Financial
Accounts for Tax/VAT at **Administer > CiviContribute > Financial
Account**. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on **Add
Financial Account**.

To create the sales tax Account, make sure **Financial Account Type** is
set to **Liability**. Select **Enabled** and **Is Tax** and specify the
**Tax Rate**. Note if you use **Quick Books**, the **Account Type Code**
should be set to **SALESTAX**. **Accounting Code** should be based on the
organization's specific accounting codes.

After you create the Financial Account, you can assign it to the
specific Financial Type by going to **Adminster > CiviContribute >
Financial Types**.  Find the Financial Type this sales tax applies to,
and click on **Accounts**. Click on **Assign Account**.

QuickBooks, you should involve your organization's bookkeeper or
accountant in setting up your Financial Types and Financial Accounts.
