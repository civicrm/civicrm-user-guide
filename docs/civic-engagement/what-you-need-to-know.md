What You Need To Know
=====================

CiviEngage is designed to manage interactions with constituents that
happen as part of an organisation's civic engagement and base-building
work, such as canvassing and phone banking.

This chapter describes the concepts you need to understand to use
CiviEngage effectively. Following key concepts, you will find key
questions that will help you to model your universe of constituents
using CiviEngage. 

CiviEngage enhances the use of CiviCampaign, and they are designed to be
used together. Read more about CiviCampaign in the Campaign section. 

Key Concepts
------------

Understanding the following concepts will enable you to use CiviEngage
effectively.

### CiviEngage and CiviCampaign

CiviEngage and CiviCampaign are tied closely together in that each
provides features and custom data that work together to accomplish
community organising activities. For example, you can:

-   create and conduct surveys to capture responses during door-knocking
    canvasses (using walklists) and phonebanking from your target
    audience
-   create and conduct a petition to capture more detailed responses
-   create reports to analyse the responses from your constituency to
    help you determine the next strategies in a programme or campaign
-   record an engagement index in an individual's activity record to
    gauge their level of interest or potential to be a highly active
    member or be easily mobilised for direct actions.

To learn more about CiviCampaign, refer to the Campaign section. There
are also separate sections for Survey and Petition which should be read
in conjunction with this section.

### Custom Fields and Profiles

CiviEngage packages custom fields sets that help you to organise
information about your constituents for civic engagement and community
organising work. In this way, CiviEngage helps you to take advantage of
features such as walk lists and phone bank lists for civic engagement
work, and surveys to collect responses form your constituents. See the
chapter Creating Custom Fields in the section Your Data and CiviCRM for
more details about how to use custom fields sets and custom profiles.

### Cleaning your Address Data

Cleaning your address data means standardising addresses to conform to
the conventions defined by your postal address standards. Standardising
how addresses are entered into CiviCRM will allow for more accurate
search results when searching by address and is essential to generating
accurate walk list reports. CiviCRM will parse addresses based on
address standards.

To find out more about how address parsing is handled and used in
CiviCRM, refer to the Address Settings subsection of the Installation &
Basic Set-up chapter of this book. When adding or editing contacts you
will be entering or editing address elements including street number,
street name, and street unit according to these standards.

When planning to import pre-existing data into CiviCRM for use in
CiviEngage it is essential that you clean up address data *before*
importing.

### Disabling versus Deleting CiviEngage Custom Data

If you decide you don't need to use or view particular custom groups,
fields, or values, we strongly recommend that you disable the custom
group, field, or value rather than delete it. Custom reports and
searches rely on these custom fields, so deleting certain custom data
could potentially break or at least cause problems for the reports and
searches.

### Working with Your Universe of Contacts

In preparing for a campaign, you will need to identify the audiences you
will be targeting for your canvass or phone bank. CiviCRM uses Smart
Groups and regular Groups as the mechanisms to target specific groups of
contacts. Here are some examples of how you can use Smart Groups and
regular Groups for targeting during your campaign:

-   use Smart Groups to identify contacts you want to target based on
    specific criteria, such as voter demographics, issue interests,
    primary language spoken, etc.
-   track voter demographics using the custom data group called Voter
    Info
-   use Groups set up as mailing lists to identify contacts who want to
    subscribe to a particular newsletter or issue to send an email blast
    about your campaign
-   use these Smart Groups and regular Groups to generate your walk list
    or phone bank list.

Learn more about working with Smart Groups and regular Groups in the
Tags and Groups chapter of this book.

### Working with Voter History

CiviEngage enables you to manage voter history and other voter
information collected during a voter engagement, voter education or
electoral cycle.

Many organisations have access to a voter file from which they manage
all their voter engagement work outside of CiviCRM. Once the voter
engagement or electoral campaign is over and voter information is
updated with who voted and other demographics, organisations will often
only want to keep information on the actual contacts they made during
the campaign. In this case, only those selected records from the voter
file and additional voter information, such as responses to specific
electoral campaign questions, a voter ID, and their registered party can
be imported and maintained in CiviCRM. These voter records then become
contacts that organisers will continue to engage and target for their
base-building efforts.

### Custom Contact Subtypes

CiviEngage creates new contact subtypes for Individuals and
Organisations:

Individual Contact Subtypes:

-   Media Contact
-   Funder Contact
-   Elected Official

Organisation Contact Subtypes:

-   Media Outlet
-   Foundation 

These subtypes allow you to track specific contacts such as funders and foundations, media contacts and elected officials, and record tailored information for each one.

**Funders and Foundations:** 

-   Track due dates for grant proposals, letters of inquiries and
    reports by adding an activity to the funder's contact record and
    choosing from the Proposal, Letter of Inquiry, or Report activity
    types.
-   Tailor information about an individual funder, such as their funding
    areas and issue interests by creating a new contact record with the
    individual contact subtype Funder Contact and using the Funder Info
    custom field set.
-   Tailor information about a foundation (organisation record), such as
    their program areas for funding creating a new contact record with
    the organisation contact subtype Foundation and using the Grant Info
    custom field set.

**Media Contacts and Media Outlets:**

-   Record which media contacts or outlets are interested in your
    organisation's issues, or have written articles about your work, and
    for identifying who to contact when you want to publicise the work
    the organisation is undertaking.
-   Tailor information about an individual media contact or
    organisation, such as their media type (e.g. TV, Newspaper,
    Photographer, etc.), issue interests and area of operation (or beat)
    using the Media Info custom field set.

**Elected Officials:**

-   Record who is an elected official in a specific district, and who to
    contact on their staff, such as the scheduler, or spokesperson.
-   Tailor information about an individual elected official, such as
    their elected position and role, using the Elected Official Info
    custom field set; staffers and spokespeople for an elected official
    can also be entered with the Elected Official subtype.

See the next chapter, Set-up, for information about how to tailor
subtypes.

Key Questions
-------------

The following questions are designed to help you make best use of
CiviEngage.

-   Who are your organisation's constituents and what issues affect
    them?
-   Who are other important individuals and organisations related to
    your work (such as community leaders, donors, elected
    officials, media contacts and funders)? 
-   What do you need to know about your constituents to create targeted
    communications and appeals to mobilise? 
-   Will you do voter engagement work and use the results to enhance
    your current contact data?
