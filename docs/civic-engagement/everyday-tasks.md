Everyday Tasks
==============

This chapter provides instructions on how to do some of the common tasks
using CiviEngage.

Conducting a door-knock canvass
-------------------------------

CiviEngage allows you to easily print walk lists for your volunteers or
staff who are doing door-knocking activities and want to conduct a
survey at the door.

Door-knocking canvass activities may be one strategic activity that's
part of a larger campaign, so you may want to set up a Campaign if you
haven't done so already. To learn more about working with campaigns and
surveys, refer to the sections Campaign and Survey respectively. You
will also want to review the previous chapter called Set-Up in this
section to learn more about setting the custom data sets and profiles to
be used in your Walklist survey.

### **Create the campaign and survey for the walk list**

1.  Create a new group of contacts that you will be targeting during
    your door-knock canvass. You may do this by searching for contacts
    who live in a particular geographic area or district. (To learn
    about working with groups, see the chapter Tags and Groups.)
2.  To create a new Campaign (if you haven't already) go to
**Campaigns > New Campaign**. Refer to the section *Campaign* for detailed
    instructions on how to create a campaign and add the group of
    contacts you created.
3.  Go to **Campaigns > New Survey**; give the survey a title and
    select the appropriate campaign that it is part of.
4.  From the **Activity Type** dropdown menu select **WalkList**.
5.  From the **Profile** dropdown menu select the custom profile you
    created for use with this Walklist survey.
6.  For **Survey Responses** select **Use existing result set** and
    select **Survey Default Results Set Options**.
7.  Click **Save**.

volunteer can record the responses directly into CiviCRM.

1.  Go to **Campaigns > Interview Respondents**.
2.  Enter the name of your survey and the name of the target group you
    surveyed during the canvass; you may also enter the street name if

Conducting a PhoneBank
----------------------

CiviEngage allows you to easily to enter responses from constituents
during a PhoneBank directly into CiviCRM.

Phone banking activities may be one strategic activity within a larger
campaign, so you will want to set up the Campaign if you haven't done so

about setting the custom data sets and profiles to be used in your
PhoneBank survey.

### **Create the campaign and survey for the PhoneBank**

Creating a survey for phonebanking is the same process as creating a
survey for walklists.

1.  Create a new group of contacts that you will be targeting during
    your phone bank. To learn about working with groups, see the chapter
    Tags and Groups.
2.  Create a new Campaign (if you haven't already) by going
    to **Campaigns > New Campaign**. Refer to the section Campaign to
    find out how to create a campaign and add the group of contacts you
    created.
3.  Go to **Campaigns > Create New Survey** and create a new survey of
    type **PhoneBank**.
4.  From the **Profile** dropdown menu select the custom profile you
    created for this phonebank survey.  
5.  For**Survey Responses** select **Use existing result set** and the
    set, **Survey Default Results Set Options**.
6.  Click**Save**.

### **Reserve the target group you want to survey**

Next, you'll need to reserve the target group of contacts you will be
surveying during the phone bank:

1.  Go to **Campaigns > Reserve Respondents**.
2.  Select the name of your survey in **Survey** and your target group
    in **Group(s)**.
3.  Click **Search**.
4.  On the**Find Respondents to Reserve** screen, select the contacts
    you want to survey, then click **Go** to **Reserve Respondents**.
5.  On the **Reserve Respondents** screen, click **Reserve**.

### **Conduct your phone bank and record responses**

During the phone bank, organisers and volunteers can search for the
group of contacts they will be calling and enter the responses directly
into CiviCRM.

1.  Go to **Campaigns > Interview Respondents**.
2.  Enter the name of your survey and the name of the target group you
    surveyed during the phone bank.

results of the survey. Refer to the chapter Reports and Analysis to
learn how to view this report.

Mobilising Individuals to a Direct Action Event
-----------------------------------------------

The Participant Info custom data group that comes with CiviEngage
contains fields that hold information about prospective event
participants, including a history of interactions between your
organisation and prospective participants. Use this information (such as
needs for childcare or rides) to bring these individuals to your events.
Tracking the history of your organisation's contact with individuals
around events such as an annual membership meeting, a direct action, or
leadership training can help you to understand the effectiveness of your
outreach methods and determine how committed or engaged an individual is
based on if the individual actually attends events after multiple
contacts.

This feature is mostly useful for organisers or staff who have a list of
individuals they are recruiting to attend an event through multiple
phone calls or face-to-face meetings. The following CiviCRM tasks could
be used to mobilise individuals:

1.  Conduct a basic or advanced search or use Groups and Smart Groups to
    create a list of the contacts you want to mobilize or invite to the
    event.
2.  From the search results or Group Contacts screen, you can add the
    list of contacts to the event by selecting **Add Contacts to Events**
    from the actions list. To find out more about how to add contacts to
    events, refer to the Everyday Tasks chapter in the Events section in
    this book.
3.  Once you have added the contacts to the event, you can enter
    participant information or responses from multiple interactions in
    the **Participant Info** area in a contact's participant record. You
    can either enter information for one participant by editing the
    participant record itself, or you can add information for a list of
    participants at one time. For example, if you plan to call through
    your list by viewing the participant list from the event listing,
    you could use **Batch Update Participants Via Profile** and select
    one of the following custom profiles provided by CiviEngage:

-   **Update Event Invite Responses** - to record responses from
    multiple contacts with the participant.
-   **Update Participant Info** - to record general information about
    participants, such as if they need childcare or rides to the event.

Using the Engagement Index
--------------------------

You can record the level of interest or engagement in a specific
activity by of an individual contact. This allows you to then review an
individual's activities to understand if their interests or engagement
has increased over time, or give you the opportunity to have further
contacts with the individual to increase their participation in your
issues.

You can record an **Engagement Index** for the following activities or
actions: **Phone Call, Meeting** or **Interview**.

1.  From an Individual's contact record, click **Actions** then select
    an activity such as **Meeting**.
2.  Fill out the information about the activity, then enter the
    **Engagement Index**. To find out how to create options for the
    Engagement Index, see the section called Campaign.

Manage Voter Information
------------------------

CiviEngage enables you to manage voter history and other voter
information collected during a voter engagement, voter education or
electoral cycle.

If you wish to collect voter contacts with their demographics, history
and additional information and add them as contacts, or enhance your
contact list with voter information, you can:

1.  Export the contacts you want, including the CiviCRM internal Contact
    ID, First name, Last name, address information, and any other
    contact information.
2.  Upload the list into your voter management system and match to the
    voter records. You can then continue conducting your voter education
    and engagement activities there.
3.  When the electoral cycle is over, export the contacts you want (new
    and existing), and import into CiviCRM. With the existing contacts,
    you'll be able to do an **update import** to match the contacts back
    into CiviCRM.
4.  Use the **Voter Info** custom field set to capture your voter
    information related to the contact.
