Starting in v4.7, the CiviCRM System Status screen shows you a view of the current status of your CiviCRM installation. It is found at **Administer > Administration Console > System Status**.

Items in *Red* need to be addressed as soon as possible. An item in red generally indicates something broken that will stop CiviCRM from working normally.

Items in *Orange* should be addressed as soon as you can and may stop you from completing key CiviCRM tasks.  

Items in *Green* are set up correctly and are on the screen for information only.
