Set-up
======

This chapter describes the steps to set up a survey. If you are
connecting a survey to a specific campaign, you will want to review the
Campaigns section as well.

Creating a survey requires that you use custom data sets to create the
questions/responses you want to capture, and then use a profile to
organize your questions the way you want them to appear on the survey.


**Tips:**

-   If you plan on conducting many surveys throughout the year (let's
    say 20 - 30 surveys in a year) with only a few questions per survey
    (let's say 3-4 questions per survey), then we strongly suggest that
    you create ONE custom data set that includes all the questions for
    each of the surveys. Then you can create individual custom profiles
    for each survey that pull in the questions that are particular to
    that survey.

-   If you plan on conducting just a few surveys per year (let's say
    about 3-4 surveys per year) with the number of questions no more
    than 10 per survey, then we suggest that you create different custom
    data sets for each group of questions per survey. Then you can use
    custom profiles to pull in in the questions that are particular to a
    survey. 

Survey Types
------------

You can create new survey types to describe the type of activity you are
conducting. Survey responses will be recorded in an activity record for
an individual. The default CiviCRM survey types are Survey, Canvass,
PhoneBank, WalkList, and Petition.

To create or edit survey types:

1.  Go to **Administer > CiviCampaign > Survey Types**.

2.  Click on **Add Survey Type** and complete the form.

Creating the survey fields
--------------------------

Once you have determined your survey questions and responses, the next
step is to create the custom data fields:

1.  Create a custom data field set by going to **Administer > Customize > Custom Data** and clicking on **Add a Set of Custom Fields.** To
    learn more about how to create custom field sets (including adding
    fields with multiple answers), see the chapter called Creating
    Custom Fields in Your Data and CiviCRM.
2.  Create the custom data set(s) so that they are used
    for **Activities.** The Activity type must be either/or; Canvas,
    PhoneBank, Survey, Walklist. 
    **Hint:** If you plan on doing a PhoneBank and want to do the data
    entry directly into CiviCRM, then you may want to add the phone
    number in the profile, and set it to view only, so that you can see
    the phone numbers when you're interviewing the respondents. 
    **Hint:** If you are adding a Walklist survey, for each field you
    might want to add the field label in full but add shorter values.
    These values are then used in the printed list of Walklist addresses
    used by the survey collectors. This might make for easier question
    response recording. So a full question response (the label) might be
    'Wrong address' and the value might be 'WA'. See the chapter **Survey > Everyday Tasks** for more information.
3.  Add the questions to the field set and any help text that you wish
    to provide and click **Save** to create the field set for the
    responses.
4.  You can now either create a profile to hold your questions, from the
    main profile screen, or you can create the profile when you add your
    new survey.

Create a new survey
-------------------

1.  Go to **Campaigns > New Survey**.
2.  Enter a Title for your survey and if the survey is part of a
    campaign, select the campaign from the dropdown menu.
3.  Choose the type of **Activity** (e.g. Canvas, PhoneBank, Survey or
    Walklist)
4.  **Instructions for Interviews**: enter any appropriate information
    about the survey that would be helpful for the volunteers conducting
    the survey.
5.  **Maximum Reserved at one time**: enter the maximum number of
    contacts that can be reserved at any one time to be interviewed.
    This allows you to divide up the group of individuals for each
    volunteer to interview at one time.
6.  **Total reserved per interview**: enter the total number of contacts
    that can be reserved by any interviewer.
7.  **Release frequency**: enter the number of days that reserved
    respondents are released if they have not been surveyed within that
    time.
8.  Click **Save**, or **Save and Next** to add questions to your survey
9.  When adding **questions** you can add two profiles. One to collect
    information on the contact and one for the survey questions. In both
    cases you can either select an existing profile, edit/copy an
    existing profile or create a new profile. (When you create a new profile within a survey you will be taken to a drag and drop profile builder screen. Here you can select any individual or activity standard or custom field and add them to your profile.
Fields can be renamed, the order and other field settings can be changed
and you can also name the profile.)
10. **Survey Results** are used to record and track the **status** of
    each completed survey (e.g. Completed, No Answer, Call. If you
    have created an earlier survey with a survey Result Set you want to
    use again, select the appropriate Result Set. Otherwise,
    click **Create a new result set** and enter the status results you
    want to track for responses to the survey, for example: 'Completed,
    Not Home, Moved, Wrong Address, Deceased'.

    **Hint:** The Drupal CiviEngage module creates Survey Default Result
    Set Options to help you track the status of the responses to the
    survey if appropriate (e.g. Completed, Moved, Wrong Number, Wrong
    Address, etc.). See the Setup chapter in the Civic Engagement
    section of this book.
