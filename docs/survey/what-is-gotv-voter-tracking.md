What is GOTV (Voter Tracking)?
==============================

CiviCampaign includes a "Get Out the Vote" GOTV (Voter Tracking) feature
so you can indicate the contacts (who you have or plan to survey) who
have voted at the polls.

You will need to enable the CiviCampaign component to be able to use
GOTV (Voter Tracking). See the *Campaign* section for more information
about CiviCampaign.

Tracking Contacts Who Voted at the Polls
----------------------------------------

Before you can use the GOTV (Voter Tracking) feature, you will need to
have created a survey, create the group of contacts you plan on
interviewing, and reserve respondents (reserve the contacts you want to
interview) for that survey. To learn more about surveys and reserving
respondents, refer to the section Surveys in this book. 

To use the GOTV (Voter Tracking) feature:

Click **Campaigns > GOTV (Voter Tracking**).

On the GOTV (Voter Tracking) search screen:

-   **Survey** (required): select the name of the survey you are using
    to survey your contacts
-   **Group(s)**: select the group of contacts whom you want to track
    who has voted
-   click **Search.**

On the GOTV (Voter Tracking) screen:

-   Check box under the column **Voted?** next to the individual you
    know has voted at the polls
-   You can float your cursor over the "individual contact" icon next to
    a person's name to find out more information about that individual
