Reports and analysis
====================

There a few searching and reporting tools at your disposal to report and
analyse your campaigns.

Campaign searches
-----------------

All searches for components that can be part of a campaign have a
campaign filter so that you can search for events, contributions, etc.
based on campaign. Similarly the tabs for components in advanced search
also have a campaign filter so you can search for contacts based on
their participation in campaigns. 

Campaign reports
----------------

As campaigns can be made up of many components there is no specific
campaign report. Instead, once CiviCampaign has been enabled you will be
able to add a column showing the associated campaign to contribution,
pledge, event, mailing and membership reports. In addition you will be
able to "filter by campaign" to restrict the records displayed in these
reports.

The activity report can be configured to display both the campaign and
the engagement index and can also be filtered on either or both
criteria.
