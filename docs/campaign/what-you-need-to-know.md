What You Need To Know
=====================

Before you create a campaign, it's a good idea to review the concepts in
this chapter to understand how CiviCampaign can best help you manage
your work, and consider the key questions in relation to your
organisation's specific needs.

Key Concepts
------------

Your organisation will likely have its own campaign strategies and
processes. CiviCampaign is a tool that you can use in conjunction with
your existing methods, to streamline and automate certain processes.

### Campaign Goals and Revenue

Define and document the concrete goals of the campaign, and what you
hope to raise in funds (if applicable), and record it in the campaign
information. This will enable you to use reports to analyze the
effectiveness of a campaign at its conclusion.

### Planning Your Campaign Activities

As you plan the strategy of your campaign and identify your target
audience, determine what activities and information can be recorded
within CiviCRM. Make sure that all recorded activities and information
is connected to the campaign, so that you can track all efforts and
individuals' activities related to the campaign. This allows you to to
make periodic and overall evaluations of the effectiveness of your
activities, strategies and outreach efforts.

Key Questions
--------------

Answer these questions in the context of your organisation or a specific
campaign:

-   Who are your target audience, and how will you reach them? Remember
    that the audience for your campaign activities may not be the same
    as the audience you are trying to reach with the actual campaign
    itself. Understanding your target audience will help you to choose
    the most appropriate strategies and communication activities to
    achieve the goal(s) of your campaign.
-   What activities and strategies, such as events and mailings, will be
    associated with this campaign?
-   How will you be gathering data during the campaign (e.g. surveys,
    petitions, event registrations) and who will be responsible for
    entering the data into CiviCRM?
-   What kind of reports will be useful for monitoring progress and
    evaluating the campaign at its conclusion?
