Reports and analysis
====================

There are a few techniques for reporting on and analysing grants. The
grant dashboard gives a quick overview of your grant types. Aside from
this there are

-   The Find Grants search form
-   The grants tab in advanced search
-   The Grant report

Searching for grant data
------------------------

CiviCRM makes an important distinction between contacts and grants.
Sometimes it is useful to get the answer to your grant related question
in terms of contacts, e.g. which contacts were successful grant
applicants in 2011. Other times it is more useful to have the answer in
terms of grants, e.g. how many grants applications did we get for our
Community Chest this year? Think about whether you are interested in the
grant or the contact before doing any grant searching.

The Find grants search allows you to search based on grant data and
return grants. The Advanced search allows you to search based on most
grant data and combine that with other contact information and return
contacts.

Searching based on these criteria gives you access to simple totals. It
also the option to export as CSV for further analysis.

Grant reports
-------------

Out of the box, CiviCRM comes with one report that can be used for
Grants. This report can be used, for example to show details for all
grants of a particular grant type. The report has agregatted statistics
at the bottom for amount requested and granted.

If you can't do what you want with a built in report or search, consider
commissioning a new report or custom search. Read the CiviReport section
for more information.
