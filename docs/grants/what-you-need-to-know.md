What You Need To Know
=====================

CiviGrant is designed to help grant-giving organisations to manage this
process. CiviGrant is one of the simpler CiviCRM components so if you
are familiar with other CiviCRM components, you will probably find
CiviGrant quite straightforward.

Key Concepts
------------

An understanding of the following key concepts will help you to make the
best use of CiviGrant.

### CiviGrant workflow

The standard CiviGrant workflow starts with the details of the grant
that a contact is applying for, including the amount applied for and
when the application was received. You can then record the stages of the
process including when the grant decision was made, how much was
granted, when money was transferred, when the grant report was due and
if it has been received.

### Grant types

Use grant types to specifiy the different types of grant that your
organisation distributes. You can set up as many grant types as you
like, and you can also search based on grant type.

### Grant statuses

CiviGrant comes with three default grant statuses: Pending, Granted and
Rejected. You can add more grant statuses to match your workflow.

### Application forms and eligibility criteria

You can create application processing forms and eligibility criteria in
CiviGrant, using CiviCRM's custom data fields. Think about what fields
should be attached to the *contact* who has applied for the grant, and
what fields should be attached to the *grant*.

Key questions
-------------

Once you've familiarised youself with the concepts outlined above, and
before you begin to work with CiviGrant, answer the following questions:

-   What grant types does your organisation offer?
-   What is your grant application workflow and how can you map it to
    CiviGrant statuses?
-   Do you have an application form, and if so, how can you model it
    using custom data?
-   What kinds of reports to you want to generate from the grant
    process?
