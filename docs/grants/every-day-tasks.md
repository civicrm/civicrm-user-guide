Everyday tasks
===============

This section discusses the every day tasks associated with administering
grants with CiviGrant.

CiviGrant Dashboard
--------------------

Go to **Other > Grants > Dashboard** to access the CiviGrant
Dashboard. Here you will see a summary of the grants registered in your
CiviCRM database, and a table of recent grant recipients.

Viewing grants
--------------

There are a couple of ways to view grants:

-   The **Grants dashboard** gives a summary of the status of all
    grants in your CiviCRM, grouped by grant type. It also gives an
    overview of recent grants.
-   An individual contact's grants can be viewed from the **Grants** tab
    on their record.

Adding and editing grant recipients
-----------------------------------

After Wookie Hole Community Action selected its grant recipients for the
Cave Festival, their grant administrator looked up the contact record of
each successful applicant and entered a new grant record for each one.

To add or edit grant recipients:

1.  Go to **Other > Grants > New Grant**.
2.  Either select an already existing contact or create a new contact to
    add the grant to.
3.  Complete the details of the grant. Fill in as many details as
    possible, including any custom data that has been set up; but you
    can also edit and update the grant details at a later stage.
4.  Click **Save**.

Grants can be edited and updated at any time using the edit link which
appears in the grant record.

Recording Reports
-----------------

When reports are received from grant recipients, you can edit the grant
information (either from the CiviGrant dashboard or the contact's
record). Check the **Grant Report Received?** box in the form and add
any appropriate notes.
