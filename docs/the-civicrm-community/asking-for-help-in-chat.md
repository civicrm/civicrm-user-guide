You might have been linked here because you've asked a question on CiviCRM chat. 

## Detail
* Detailed questions are easier to answer than vague ones. People are more likely to reply if your question has enough information for them to know the answer. For example: "I can't install CiviCRM" is not a descriptive question; "When I try to install CiviCRM, I see _error XYZ_ on screen" is descriptive enough to be answered. Give details! Lots of details.
* Let us know what version of CiviCRM you're running, what CMS and version you're using and other information on your configuration (are you using any caching systems (Memcache, Redis etc).

## Research
* Search the web to see if others have asked your question, especially https://docs.civicrm.org and https://civicrm.stackexchange.com
* Share what you've tried ("I read the docs at https://docs.civicrm.org and it says to do X, Y, Z, but when I do Y I don't see the expected screen"). This will help those responding to answer appropriately.

## Etiquette
* Try to ask in the right channel - [~user-support](https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/user-support) for using CiviCRM, [~dev-newcomers](https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/dev-newcomers) for new developer support, [~town square](https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/town-square) if you're unsure.
* Avoid posting the same question in multiple channels.
* Be patient. We try to be a helpful and supportive community, and we all lead busy lives. If no-one answers, check back later, or try posting on https://civicrm.stackexchange.com
* Ask one question at a time!
