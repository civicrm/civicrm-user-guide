# What is CiviCase?

CiviCase is a tool for tracking and managing sequences of interactions
between people in your organisation and contacts in CiviCRM. It's
similar to a case management system. In addition to tracking and
managing your organisation's interactions with clients or constituents,
CiviCase can also help you manage internal organisational interactions.

Cases are used to track complex interactions or communication
processes. A case can be used to:

-   track a specific workflow or set of procedures that must be followed
    and that involves a number of different organisational staff
-   allow staff to manage and track interactions while avoiding
    duplication
-   automate the task of remembering and scheduling follow-up
    activities.

CiviCase relies on Activities. To learn about how they work, see the
Activities chapter.

Organisations have employed CiviCase in a wide variety of situations.
Here are a couple of examples of different types of organisations that
use CiviCase. 

## Scenario: managing legislator-constituent interactions

A legislator's staff manages hundreds of interactions with constituents
and communities daily. Legislative staff can manage and track these
interactions while avoiding duplicating work (for example, if a
constituent calls in about an issue, the staffer taking the call can
look at the activities in the case related to the issue and see that
another staffer is already working on the issue and relay that
information to the caller). CiviCase also automates the task of
remembering and scheduling follow up activities by presenting staffers
with a list of upcoming case activities that require their attention.

CiviCase came in handy to track a series of related tasks that
legislative staff do as a result of interactions with constituents,
including:

-   A legislative staffer received a phone call about illegal dumping
    near the caller's home. The staffer created a case recording the
    details and location of the reported issue. She then assigned the
    task of following up with the Health Department to another member of
    the legislator's staff. Upon logging-in to CiviCRM, the other staff
    member saw that the task was assigned to them. He then contacted the
    Health Department on behalf of the constituent, and contacted the
    constituent to confirm that the Health Department was informed of
    the situation. 
-   The legislator's office received a phone call from a constituent
    requesting support from an agency. A staffer logged the call in
    CiviCase and then set up a follow-up call for the next week to make
    sure that action was taken on the agency's behalf.
-   The legislator's staff records event invitations on an ongoing basis
    that a legislator's scheduler must respond to.

## Scenario: complex application process

An organisation administering a health department grant programme to
distribute several million dollars worth of grants used CiviCase to
manage the grant applications process. When interested parties submitted
their initial applications, a case was automatically created to manage
each. The case created contained several activities which were
automatically assigned to different staff managing the application
process.

In this instance the users were actually from three separate
organisations who each had to apply their assessment of the application
in turn. First, a basic initial assessment was made to check that
certain criteria were met. Then an external organisation made a more
technical assessment. The activities were all offset from the start of
the case by the number of days in which it was anticipated they should
be completed and a coordinator from each organisation assigned the case
activities to members of staff according to their capacity as they came
in.

At various stages in the process, the status of the case was changed for
one reason or another. In this process the main options were:

-   passed basic checks
-   failed basic checks
-   technically feasible
-   technically infeasible
-   suppliers approved
-   suppliers disallowed
-   deferred to next round
-   accepted.

Even though there were thousands of applications and tens of thousands
of parts of the application review process, the coordinators from the
first two organisations assigned activities to staff members so they
each saw a case dashboard showing only the work assigned to them,
helping them focus their energy on just their segment of the
applications.

For the final assessment, the two organisations hired an external
organisation to process the remaining applications. For this process, a
review committee was able to view the key details of applications with
different statuses, and finally, just review the summary details of all
applications with an accepted status to make a final determination.

## CiviCase in use 

Here's a simple example of a Housing Support case. The Open Case
activity is marked as Completed when the case is opened. Three
additional activities are automatically scheduled when the case is
opened. A medical evaluation is scheduled for the following day
(reference offset is 1); then secure temporary housing (reference offset
2); and finally a follow-up three days later.

In this example there are three case roles. The Homeless Service
Coordinator is both the creator and manager of these cases. In addition,
a Health Services Coordinator and a Benefits Specialist role are created
when the case is opened.
