What is CiviPledge?
===================

A pledge is the promise to give a donation at a pre-arranged time in the
future, either in full, or at regular intervals until a total goal is
reached. For example, Sally pledges to give $3000 over five years, at
regular monthly intervals of $50 each.

In CiviCRM, donors can make a pledge themselves through an online
contribution form (see the 'Contributions' section), or internal users
may do so on their behalf. Payments are handled separately, either
manually (e.g. cheque) or automatically through a payment processor, and
the pledge itself is the 'umbrella' that links all of the individual
contributions together.

If a donor has missed a payment, the status of the pledge can be updated
accordingly, and email reminders may be set for delivery automatically
at specified intervals before the payments are due, to remind donors of
their commitment.
