CiviMail A/B Testing
====================

CiviMail A/B Testing allows you to send two test e-mails to two random
samples of your recipients. After the test mailings are complete, you
can choose to send the more successful mailing, based on the metrics
available, to your remaining recipients. This chapter looks at the type
of testing available and how to configure a new test.

Before conducting a new A/B Test, be sure you put your recipients in a
Mailing List. To learn more about how to configure Mailing List see the
chapters on *Groups and Tags*.

**Type of Tests**

**Creating a New A/B Test**

To create a New A/B Test, navigate to **Mailings > New A/B Test**. At
the Setup screen you can define the campaign that corresponds with the
mailing and select the type of testing you want to conduct.

There are three different type of tests you can perform, these are:

-   Different **Subject** lines
-   Different **From** lines
-   Testing entirely different emails

At the Target screen you can define your recipients and the distribution
percentage. You can modify the percentage of test mailing by dragging
the blue percentage bar, which in turn controls the percentage of final
mailings that will be sent to the remaining participants. The total of
the test mailings and the final mailing will sum up to 100%.

The Compose screen will change dependent on the type of A/B Test you are
performing. For example, if you chose to conduct a test on "different
From lines," the compose screen will contain two **From** fields. 

When you test using the **From** field, you will have the option to
enter From (A) and From(B)

When you test using the **Subject** field, you will have the option to
enter Subject(A) and Subject(B)

When you test using entirely different emails, you will add a **From** and
**Subject** for each mailing:

Choose an email template that you have previously composed. Once you
have selected your email template and specified the From and Subject
field, make sure you send a test email before scheduling or sending your
final mailing. 

**Metrics**

Once you have completed your test mailings, you will have access to your
results by navigating to **Mailings > Manage A/B Tests**, then
selecting **Results**. On the A/B Test Results screen you can
monitor your test results and select which mailings should be submitted
as the Final mailing.
